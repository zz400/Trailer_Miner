Obviously, to generate excitement, the trailer makes it look like it's another ""Cloverfield,"" but I believe, on several instances, you can clearly see a second monster in the various clips. First, the glowing appendage that the soldiers find underground. Second, the thing that's flying and swats the airplanes from the sky and then plunges into the ocean. Third, the glowing appendage that slams down on the concrete. And fourth, when the soldiers on the roof shoots the red lights into the sky, revealing a monster that looks nothing like Godzilla. I think what you'll see is Godzilla fighting another entity (alien?) inside at least one American city. I could be wrong, but this looks pretty bad ass. ",0,1,Beergut222,GjMuvAHgx5E,-0.053641679957469435,2014-02-25 18:52:44,True,True

Sorry for the spoilers for the ppl who haven't watch the movie yet. At wreck scene of the train fill with passengers in the movie Lt.Broody  ask something to a soldier and the soldier reply with these next small sentence. ""I don't know, I guess were some kind of monster hunter's now"". Now I don't know if this is an easter egg and if it is one of the golden ones, now tht part just make me wonder If Capcom is looking for a studio in these case for example WB, in order to bring the Monster Hunter series to the big screen. But hey just to be clear that sentence could be that just a sentence or a reference to the 80-90s Godzilla movies but then again, what if Capcom and WB make way for a MH movies. I personally would like to see that happen because I'm a fan of MH myself and yes MH don't have a plot story is just a Hunter that you create yourself and start hunting monsters in the game on the other hand the studio can come up with an great storyline and bring the game to the big screen.

2016-08-30T11:27:13,"In spite of all the pathetic outrage & protest coming from the usually considerably infantile Japanese community over the '98 version, after their much revered-venerable monster, so-perceived a ""Hero"" was depicted instead as a villain of sorts or rather more accurately an over-sized animal w/o much of any intellect, driven only so much by its natural instinct to pro-create, spawn or watevr..& their by & large also negative-thumbs-down opinions of the 2014 version. Was by my opinion, highly biased & for the most part, influenced by the usual, run-of-the-mill patriotic, self-appraising attitudes, so prevalent these days. And as if, they can do to the mentioned films any better. Starkly in contrast, in retrospect, none of the native Japanese made ones actually hold up to Hollywood made Sci-Fi standards, wic brought audiences such incredible realism. Evntho' in the back of our minds, we're well aware they're all fictitious & we're so much only enjoying a good time, freeing our minds evry once in a while from the mundane realities.",1,3,beaggyboy,GjMuvAHgx5E,0.12721611721611722,2016-08-30 11:27:13,False,False
