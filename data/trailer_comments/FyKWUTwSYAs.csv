He gets it on and they succeed without any losses. Next day a crew member asks why the red shirt, captain says, ""It's so that, in case I get shot and bleed, the crew won't notice and they'll continue fighting"".

But in a movie, especially one trying to capture the attention of a couple of different age demographics, despite the liberal use of a hard R rating, that can muddle up the final product.  I wasn't expecting it to be straightforward-linear-movie-film-for-theaters out the gate. An actually origin story. I hope those flashback moments are given more levity and irreverence. You can't generate sympathy for such a crass, vulgar, 4th-wall breaking, meta character by showing how he USED to be. There are more clever ways to inform Wade Wilson's character through his actions.  Bah, now I'm rambling. I'm hyped for this flick.

The humor was... different to the comics, it was more ""random"" and seemed more forced, and unnessisary. And when he goes ""I'm going to touch myself tonight"" after fighting tons of what we know are bad guys and inhaling somke from his guns made me kinda upset. This goes for the wrighting, its just dosent feel right. The CGI and cinematoegraphy looks good, yet we don't know much about the actual story other than how its a origin story (I hope it dosent drone on). It dosent even show us why he fights crime. (I mean most of us already know why but its kinda crutial to put in a trailer.)  Well its just a trailer and I'm going to watch it anyway, maybe it will be great. But we just have to wait and see.

Hopefully though, the jokes are better than (most) of these. Sorry, call me a conservative but I know Deadpool can be funny without the cursing or the R-rated humor and obscenities. Though I can appreciate the need for the R rating, I found Deadpool funniest breaking the 4th wall and making references in the comics or just being in absurd stories.

2015-08-07T03:32:17,"The Charleston shooting is yet another massacre orchestrated by people with advanced technology. The victims under the control of this technology, such as Dylann Roof, are known as or ""zips"" or ""zipper guns"". If you have watched The Sopranos (the characters are based on people from my local area), you may have heard them use the term ""zip"". This word is used to describe assassins from Italy who are used to do the dirty work for Tony Soprano and his crew, and their presence in the show is a metaphor for people under the control of this technology. There are a few scenes in The Sopranos where Tony plays golf, which is a metaphor for radome sites such as the CIA-ran Menwith Hill in the UK. These facilities give use of their technology to The Freemasons. There is another mention in the media of this technology in an interview between Bill O'Reilly and Jon Stewart. Jon Stewart says, ""Oh come on Bill, we're both members of the media elite here"", to which Bill O'Reilly replies, ""Oh yeah? How many zipper guns you got?"".  The nature of the technology itself is described when British TV presenter Johnny Vaughan interviewed Al Pacino. Johnny Vaughan asked Al Pacino a how he got into character for the roles he played, to which Pacino replied, ""You know, it's like you put on a suit, and get inside a box."" Vaughan answered, ""So it's a suit in a box?"". This technology can hijack the victim's body, seemingly like some virtual reality experience for the user, where they put on a ""suit"" (and I assume some form of headgear), which enables them to experience life through the eyes of the technologically-controlled victim. Then they can do whatever they like, which often involves going on rampages and killing large numbers of innocent people.  There are lots of clues as to the identity of the culprits within the details of the massacre itself; the Charleston shooting was conducted by someone with a bowl cut haircut, which is because of some guy from around my area who looks like Peter Beardsley. I think his name might be Tom or Adam, with the Cowan, Howell, Hamilton, Howe, Metcalfe and Hodgson families being frequent users of this technology. The Sandy Hook massacre was conducted by these same people, they selected the school Sandy Hook because of the name Sandy, and the fact that the person who committed the massacre was called Adam is no coincidence. There was a shooting at Arapahoe High School because someone in the UK was referred to as a ""ho"" and then there was a trend on Twitter, ""#PunkRockHo"", which escalated to the Apapahoe shooting (A Rapper Ho).",0,0,Barry Parry,FyKWUTwSYAs,0.061619047619047615,2015-08-07 03:32:17,True,True

2015-08-12T01:49:11,"The only issues I have from seeing this trailer is:  1. A lot of the action scenes in the trailer seems to be on that highway overpass. I'm hoping that his origin story doesn't take an hour so we get action the last 30 minutes or so. And also more variety to where he goes. If we do get a long origin story, I trust that Deadpool's character will make it a fun ride though.  2. I felt like the test footage nailed the ""red suit, brown pants"" joke. Maybe having a pedestrian passing by, staring at Deadpool until he starts, ""You must be wondering why the red suit, blah blah blah"" Then when he notices the trucks, he turns to the camera (or back to the pedestrian) and finishes the ""brown pants"" portion. Seems like it was kinda forced in here for the sake of having it in there because it was also in the test footage.   Everything else seems pretty true to the character.",0,0,Sib Pro Quo,FyKWUTwSYAs,0.09615384615384616,2015-08-12 01:49:11,True,True

This movie will be VERY inappropriate. TO THE KIDS: You probably shouldn't even watch this till you're older. Half of these jokes you probably won't even understand. If you really want to see this movie have your parent take you. That's the ONLY way you'll see it in theaters.

Green lighting uninspired rate R movies isn't going to get the same success. It's the originality, writing and true to the source material that captured the attention of fans. People wanted it R rate because that is what the comic was like. Instead of presuming to know what people want try reading comments and asking people. Also understand that the comic book community is your target audience. A lot of people who don't like superheros don't usually go see a superhero movie no matter how generic you make it. Stop learning the wrong messages from successful films. People liked it because it was closer to what they were familiar with not simply because it was rated R.",0,0,Kevin W.
