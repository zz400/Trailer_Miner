The trailer promised me some kind of whodunnit with great memorable characters and a unique Hercules-Poirot/Sherlock Holmes-like inspector. Instead the story focuses on two/three suspects, so that it is clear early on that it has to be one of those. Most of the characters don't get enough screen time. This makes it less thrilling.  Also the detective is not unique at all. In fact he seems to be a bit of dumb. I wanted him to be more memorable.  My third point of critique is not so much about the movie, more about a logical problem in the script: the testament in that movie is totally unjust and problematic, but it's just fiction, so I let it be   My hunt for awesome whodunnits continues.",0,0,Arishok Qunari,xi-1NchUqMA,0.2926587301587301,2020-01-10 23:59:22,False,True
