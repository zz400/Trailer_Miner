Sad that they created a story around the stories themselves, with what appears to be yet another cliche trope of annoying teens that say annoying things while we wait to see the real stuff. Would have loved it if they made each story from the books sperate. Hiw many times did they mention that the what's in the book is coming to life? 1 too many times. I mean, that's far from orginal, and even further from the series. Also the kids clearly can't emote will acting and it feels as stiff as watching the Disney channel.   Still going to watch it, but it looks like ad much of a let down as the new Stephen Kings IT, when what we're expecting was a slight revamp of the old one.   I was really really looking forward to grim and grimy style of the art in the books, instead it looks like Spielberg's Super 8.
