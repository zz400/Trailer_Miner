I assume this trailer will have over 200 0000 likes at the end of the day, if only 6 minutes from release had 20 000 likes.I hoped that Dormammu had flames on his head just like in the comics and in the animated series. But I think they might still do that in a future release of the full trailer since they have jut finished filming and are in editing and VFX development. I also hoped to see a full Dr Strange Sorcerer Supreme action, but I think that they're saving that for later as well. I think that's Wang telling Strange at the beginning of the trailer to forget everything he thinks he knows.",0,0,Mostafa Farweez,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.19090909090909094,2016-04-13 04:09:42,True,True

It seems to follow the comics well in terms of origin story. I am worried about how some actors will handle the strange/aloof/eccentric nature of their characters. Im hoping it's not a generic ""superhero story;"" being different is the only way this movie will work. Also the lack of a featured antagonist is worrying. Although, I'm glad that the trailer didn't do what every other trailer does, and give away 99% of the movie. Also, the settings look interesting. It is also refreshing to see these settings in the overplayed superhero movie genre. Also, I'm confused about how much, or how little the abstract nature of magic will be in the movie. All in all I'm very much intrigued by this movie, and excitedly anticipate it's release.",0,0,Hahv Trivaht,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.15125,2016-04-13 07:18:29,True,True

Also I don't buy Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo but I will reserve final judgement when I actually see a trailer or something with him executing some lines.

I'm not a comic book geek (which I state with respect) but I know the difference. I will see this movie because I like stories about changes/changing perceptions, including Inception or the Matrix or other such movies...Doctor Strange is essentially derivative, but essentially ALL art is derivative when you really look at it. It might be just new to you, but it's ALWAYS not new to history. The same themes just pop up again and again. So, relax your sphincters (some of you) and enjoy this interpretation of this sub-genre. No need to get all in a tizzy.

Doctor Strange is a mind-bending, psychedelic, and dark comic series. He is a practitioner of a mystic art form in which they can travel thru the very fabric of time and space. He can snap his fingers and transport The Avengers to another dimension. He's like the Bulk Beings in Interstellar. He can live and manipulate beyond the four dimensions we know. With powers like that, it would make him crucial for Infinity War. That ""Inception"" scene that you are referencing to is not the same as it was in Inception. It was quite different, just like it was in Upside Down. The visuals may be similar, but it's how I would expect a live action adaptation to look like. As much as I loved Inception, it wasn't all that original. It borrowed from The Thirteenth Floor, The Dark City, The Matrix, Videodrome, eXistenZ, and Paprika. A similar scene was in an earlier draft of X-Men: First Class, but the script was rewritten due to Inception's trailer being released. In a sense, all the mentioned films above were influenced by Doctor Strange comics, which have been around since 1963.""",0,0,Charsy,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.07578053259871441,2016-04-13 22:10:53,True,True

Dr Strange of all the Marvel characters is the most ethnically ambiguous and if Hollywood was smart could of and should of had a south or east Asian actor playing him.

Directors need to make comic book characters translate into film in a realistic way that doesn't look goofy and MCU is doing that, so is DCEU, however, DCEU is a mess because there 2 films so far have terrible plots with severe loopholes and are clustered with unnecessary symbolism. It's obvious DCEU is just trying to rush all their movies to compete with MCU when they should take their time and development their film universe on their own and not worry about MCU at all. Marvel characters have always been safe compared to DC's however Marvel can explore a vast array of characters and topics while DC can't and that's why DC is failing. Their characters and stories aren't as diverse and expansive as Marvel's, DC will never be able to make second tier characters like Vixen, Black Canary, Dr. Fate, Deathstroke and so many others popular",2,1,Antonio Brooks,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.140625,2016-04-14 02:14:15,True,True

Over 15 thousand Bernie voters in Stanton Island alone have had their registrations changed so they can't vote in the closed democratic primary this Tuesday in New York....just like what happened in Arizona. Also, in Massachusetts Bill Clinton was filmed breaking the law entering a pro Bernie voting area & shutting down that spot for 2 hours. In many states in areas where Bernie Sanders was winning the vote on election day it turns out many of those areas ran out of ballots & they literally told people to go home. In Wyoming it was a caucus. People show up & caucus for their candidate. Hillary Clinton got 14% of ""surrogate"" votes. These are votes that were counted & these ""surrogate"" votes weren't even there! She received 99% of all these ""surrogate"" votes. Hillary Clinton & the DNC just....wow. All the cheating that has happened this primary is disgusting. We are spreading the word as much as we can because CNN & MSNBC are some of her top donors to her campaign, they will not report it. But we know what's going on. It's all over twitter, youtube & we are getting the word out. We need to show up in record numbers so they can't rig it without it being so obvious to everyone. I encourage anyone who cares to listen to the town hall meeting in Arizona where thousands of people who suddenly had their registrations changed even though being registered a democrat for years. It's on youtube. This is what has been happening & people should be aware that this is going on. They expect people will vote for her after they rig the election because she is running against a republican…I hope that people see this because they will continue to pull this crap every election if we don’t stand up for ourselves.",0,0,jeff matt,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.12223800505050504,2016-04-14 07:31:50,True,True

2016-04-15T19:23:17,"Even ignoring the white-washing, this looks pretty boring. Pretty special effects are great, but the tone isn't anything special or unique. It has the inception, batman begins vibe, but without anything new. It has magic, but it doesn't feel grounded or real. The story wasn't really pinned down except dude gets hurt, finds a mentor, wants to learn magic, but it's usually fine to hold back in the first trailer. But this gets me as excited as Batman v. Superman's first trailer did, aka, bored as heck. I think it will be a pretty movie, but I think all the magic and personality went into Guardians of the Galaxy, all the action and drama went to Winter Soldier, and this is just not anything more than a few tropes and archetypes we've seen again and again strung together.  Not ignoring the white-washing now, it is a red-flag for how sensitive the director/casting directors are to audience desires and perceptions. That same audience blindness I saw in the casting of Lex Luthor in Batman v. Superman, and on the Marvel side, in Joss Whedon's tap-twist in Age of Ultron. It's a bad sign for the characters, their nuances, and how they might develop. I'm not saying they couldn't cast Tilda Swinton, but they also (upping the supernatural and mind-bending factor) could have casted a few people as equally as her to play that one character, an Asian amongst them, and had them rotate equally to bend Strange's perceptions (and the audiences as well) as to who this person really is. Appearances are deceiving could have been a trope they played with, and baring casting an Asian (in an obviously Asian role) this is the second best option.",2,2,ArtemisJami3,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.1391904391904392,2016-04-15 19:23:17,True,True

2016-05-23T05:47:39,"One of the coolest thing about this trailer is when we see Doctor Strange's soul being separated from his body. Not because of the act itself, but by the huge clue I think it gives. The color of his soul is orange. If this is so, it could give a huge clue to where the Soul Stone is. There's a character who's ability is to being able to see every soul. The color orange is very prevalent with this character and that's Heimdall. What if the Soul Stone is an actual soul, Heimdall's soul. It  would explain why the Infinity Gauntlet slot for the orange stone is not only bigger than the rest, but it's appearance is more like an energy source instead of a stone like the rest. Would make a sense as the Soul would be at the center of Space, Reality, Power, Mind and Time. If the stone on Doctor Strange necklace is an Infinity stone, then it's probably the Time Stone and not the Soul Stone like some have suggested. Heimdall's appearance in Thor's vision on Avengers: AoU made me suspicious, but now I'm almost certain this could be a thing. Other clues lie within Heimdall himself as his new armor has an orange stone in it, his eyes are orange, and his name starts with an H. That last one is super vague, but if Thanos name was meant as a clue to the location of all Stones, then maybe that's a thing. Tessaract, Aether, Orb, Scepter. We would be missing H and N.

2016-06-19T15:46:29,">> Catechism of the Catholic Church <<  III. ""You Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me""  Divination and magic  2115 God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can constitute a lack of responsibility.  2116 All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to ""unveil"" the future. Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone.  2117 All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another's credulity.",0,2,Michal Síkeli,Lt-U_t2pUHI,0.037339743589743575,2016-06-19 15:46:29,True,True

2016-11-01T18:41:04,"""Dear friends...I was very much looking forward to the upcoming Dr. Strange movie, based on the Marvel series and starring Benedict Cumberbatch. However, I will be boycotting this movie and here's why: the screenwriter, director, and studio made the decision to cast Tilda Swinton as a character who in the books is Tibetan. They did this not because of standard lazy Hollywood 'whitewashing', (which is bad enough), but directly out of fear that even mentioning the word 'Tibet' would be so offensive to China that they'd lose out on the Chinese market. In the words of the screenwriter -- C. Robert Cargill—  ""If you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he’s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.”  Well, Mr. Cargill. Tibet is in fact a place. And truth is truth, whether you choose to hide from it or not. So I'm taking the $20 I would have spent on your movie and donating it to Students for a Free Tibet instead.""   http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/world/asia/china-doctor-strange-tibet.html?_r=0",0,1,Rinzamo,Lt-U_t2pUHI,-0.05818181818181816,2016-11-01 18:41:04,False,True

2016-11-16T05:57:09,I always wondered why marvel movies feel like Disney movies. Thats because disney owns marvel studios. No wonder ppl say marvel is for kids. Everyone has their preference but even Marvel is aware of the fact that their movies are more like the divergent series cuz that's how they make them. That's why they made deadpool a R rated type movie to deviate from all the other pg movies before it. Comics do not always have to be aimed towards children under 16. Why cant they just make a good crime drama like Nolans' Dark Knight trilogy...Well then again that movie is a once in a lifetime film due to its direction. Well at least x men is a good distraction.
