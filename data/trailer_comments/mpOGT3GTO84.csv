Not a rock star in any way, shape, or form. And to add the fact that people are asking for movies that already exist? Like a Beatles movie (there’s like 400 billion beatles movies) and a Michael Jackson movie (heard of “this is it”?). I’m glad these people are getting recognition and all but it’s really the pushing of titles based on the names of songs. You know that the reason these names have been chosen is due to their significance to each band? Epic Poem (Bohemian Rhapsody) is a great name for Freddie Mercury’s extremely intense life, and rocketman perfectly describes the charisma, talent and long-lasting success that Elton John had (and continues to have).

Imagine Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury and Taron Ederton's Elton John meeting up and calling each other by their drag names that they had given eachother, or a David Bowie movie where the Bohemian Rhapsody movie cast comes back for the creation of Under Pressure with Bowie. I'd love for this to happen.
