Brandon.I like costume drama. I still have Pride & Prejudice 1995, best adaption of Austen. Colin Firth and Jennifer Eyle fitted so well together ( since they did have  romance going on at the time of filming the show,made it more intense)  Bleak House 2005. Jane Eyre , Wives and Daughters, Middlemarch, Cranford...And many other, single movies, charles dickens style.i think it is great people are out there,making efforts to put their collection of period time movies  series and audiobooks on youtube if nowhere else easily available. But at times you have to be fast,and better download them with Atubecatcher, so you can watch them with a more eased mind ,before youtube decides to  terminate them in the midst of your watch or listening.

I'm gonna watch it all from the beginning so I catch up on what I missed and I'll have a favorite character that I can understand better now. I'll write about that now, it's not that important so just be on your way. I just get defensive over someone.     Ok, so. At the very beginning, I absolutely hated Thomas. He just seemed like an arrogant guy who wanted everyone to feel miserable. But hear me out! Now that I've watched most of season 4 and all of seasons 5 and 6 I can easily tell you who my favorite is. I started liking him in season 4 because he just was so poor, he was tricked by O'Brian and he had such a giant crush on Jimmy. He never wanted to hurt anybody. And after that incident he tried so hard to make it up to him, we really got to see a new side to Thomas. If I had known that he could be so nice or that he is just so broken at the beginning I would've had my favorite sooner. He's gone through so much since season 4 and I just feel so bad for him so now, when I go to watch the movie with mum I want to see him happy.
