2015-12-15T21:46:13,"Just for all of you lot here arguing over universes and fanbases  FACT: The Marvel Universe has garnered more money than the Harry Potter series when we look at films, however they have more than double the Harry Potter movies and the Harry Potter series has a higher ratio of money to movies than Marvel. FACT: When we look at singular books (let's take the first one for example), The Philosopher's Stone is in the top 8 for most copies of a book ever purchased in our recorded history (excluding religious texts), while no Marvel comic books are prominent. FACT: There is many more Marvel/DC comic books than there is Harry Potter books, so the above statistic only applies to one book, not an entire series/franchise. FACT: Both franchises have been critically acclaimed as being excellent for showcasing universal struggles and satisfying fans. FACT: While not the undisputed view of everyone, both series have been called by a number of critics ""The Best"" of their RESPECTIVE GENRES. FACT: Harry Potter and the Marvel/DC Universe were created with different audiences in mind, even if they have evolved to encompass much larger ones, and comic books are generally classified as science fiction, while the Harry Potter series is generally classified as fantasy. FACT: WHEN TRYING TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT, USING YOUR OWN OPINION IS NOT A FACT. FACT: The above is a fact.  CONCLUSION: Stop being so subjective and trying to compare two things that are fairly even, with only slight biases in BOTH directions (depending on what you're comparing), in fan-base and popularity and just be excited that a ton of good movies are coming out next year.",1,0,Jess Pev,Wj1devH5JP4,0.27309523809523806,2015-12-15 21:46:13,True,True

2015-12-16T07:58:27,Oh great thanks Warner Bros there goes a few more years of my life. And I plan on going to see this movie definitely. I saw the majority of the Harry Potter movies in the theater besides the first one but I did see the rest of them in the theater. The first one I saw the Chamber of Secrets I saw on my own which was cool and I saw it in Downtown Evanston. I saw the majority of the Harry Potter movies in Old Orchard Mall in Skokie Illinois afterwards besides the last one. I wanted to see it at Old Orchard Mall but they didn't have it anymore so I looked online for showing of it and I found out that the movie theater in Village Crossing in Skokie also had it. So on New Years I decided that I made it a day outing for myself. I had to go out anyway so I decided to kill two birds with one stone. I had a Sega Genesis and I wanted the Sega CD with Lunar The Silver Star so after the Parade of Roses I went out to People Play Games than I came back north to catch Pace Bus 290 to get to Village Crossing. In fact I had the console add on with me the whole day and I enjoyed the day.,0,0,briansivley2001,Wj1devH5JP4,0.20802139037433157,2015-12-16 07:58:27,True,True

2015-12-17T14:58:46,"I didn't want it to be ""done"" after HP, but I didn't want them to mess with the HP story. Meaning like, extending Harry's story or redoing it. But I knew there was *so* much more they could do, movie-wise, with the franchise simply because of how vast and detailed the whole world & it's history was.  They could (and *should*) do Dumbledore spin-off movies of his earlier years! The books got into *WAY* more detail about Dumbledore, his family, and his quest for power (which really casts him in a bit of bad light, in a manner of speaking) but still manages to keep him on the fringes of being a good guy; he's someone who just made some mistakes and l;et them get the better of him in his formative years.  There is at LEAST a trilogy of movies they could do with that. Funny thing would be if they did like 5 movies about it and named each one after one of his names (Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore), which on one hand would be amazing because it would end on ""Dumbledore"", as sort of like a ""coming into the person we know him as"" sort of thing. But on the other hand it would be really odd for the 4th movie to be named ""Brian"" haha!",302,35,Fyrecide,Wj1devH5JP4,0.1641666666666667,2015-12-17 14:58:46,True,True

Part of the allure of the British wizarding world in Harry Potter is how old everything is - there is a sense that it everything has grown organically since at least the time of Merlin. It's contradictory, it's mish-mashed and there is centuries of tradition in almost everything. America has its own appeal - but not in a way that fits with Harry Potter. To me, at least.

By the looks of the cars, it seems to be set in the 1920s, which was honestly an amazing time in America in all honesty. Plus, there is an interesting history with witches and wizards in America. If you read the Crucible by Arthur Miller, the witches in Salem, Massachusetts were burned at the stake for being connected with the devil (so puritans would say). So jump forward two hundred years later, they give you Salem's Institute for Witches and Wizards in Salem, Massachusetts.   Though taken place in New York, doesn't mean they're praising America. New York city is literally the pinnacle of diversity in America. from Latin people, to Europeans, and even Asian people. The fact that this movie takes place in New York isn't because of the clicheness of using the state as some shout out to the New Yorkers.

Please can we get a movie about Albus Potter's and Scorpias Malfoy's Hogwarts banter with like cheeky winks from Prof Longbottom in Herbology  Or maybe a movie about a Hogwarts student that works his/her way up to become a famous seeker and then their country wins the Quidditch World Cup    Or (my peronal favourite idea of mine) maybe a movie about Moony Wormtail Padfoot n Prongs back in the day with like a love story of how Lily and Severus were best friends at first and then she felt betrayed by his loyalty to the dark arts so in the end she fell for James and then we could have a real dramatic and moving scene at Godrics Hollow with Voldy and the Potters with them fighting to save their son and then an explosion and then at the end it just cuts to a ahot of Harry on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive with his scar and it would just be epic feels....like a prequel to the main movies?

This is an example of taking a gigantic universe, full of stories that still haven't gotten the chance to be told, and telling one of many. Take a moment and think about how many amazing things this movie has going for it...  1. It's completely separate from Harry's story. Many fans wanted a series about Harry's kids or Harry as an adult, but that would have felt cheap. This trilogy is not a prequel, it's an extension of the wizarding world.   2. It takes place in New York. Every single American fan of HP, including myself, has pondered the possibilities of American wizarding culture. Now we're finally getting our long-awaited answers.  3. It's set in 1926. Prohibition era wizards. Nuff said.  4. The main protagonist is a Hufflepuff. Represent, Newt. Represent.  So, before all you casual trailer viewers bash on this movie, please try to understand how important it is to fans.
