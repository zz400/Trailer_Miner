Dont give them a reason. I hate when I see a person disobey orders and go and reach for something and boom, shit goes sideways. Then they cry the blues. Racism, bigotry, yada yada yada. Michael brown. Perfect example. Goes to a store, steals, assaults owner, then when cops approach him, he bucks and goes for the cops gun and they shot his ass  then the family comes forward with baby pics of him saying he's an angel and wouldn't hurt a fly, ""witnesses"" come forward saying he had his hands up and was begging for them not to hurt him. Hence the movement HANDS UP DONT SHOOT. Only when the cops came forward and showed footage to the judge did the witnesses back down and say they were sorry for lying  I dont like all cops. But I feel they get a bad rep. They deal with thugs and drug dealers and murderers EVERYDAY and have to deal with their attitude and their bullshit. So of course a cop is quick to be an asshole and will become harsh to ensure his safety. Its not rocket science. Anyone who hates the police bc they're too harsh i say this "" put urself in their shoes ""  imagine dealing with some young punk who is threatening you and won't listen to you and his record shows that he most likely is holding a gun. You gonna let him spit on you and resist arrest? You just gonna let him treat you like that.  Black lives matter has made things worse. I understand I will get alot of racist cunts who will comment saying all types of racist shit. Go right ahead. Black culture nowadays is the problem. You praise thugs, drug dealers, and people who buck on the police. You literally praise a punk who killed 4 innocent black girls in a random drive by only bc a cop ended up shooting his ass.

When a cop is arresting someone at gunpoint, do not get out and start screaming ""what did he do? Why is he under arrest?"" especially if you're a lawyer you should know better than that. When a cop has you at gunpoint, DO NOT reach for your waistband. When a cop fires his weapon at somebody, DO NOT fight him and kill him, it is not self defense. If somehow you genuinely do kill a cop in self defense, do not run away and hide from police. Innocent people don't run.  This movie is dangerous. Not in the ""social justice"" way, not in the ""making a change and fighting The Man"" way, in a real way. In Dallas, Micah Johnson was angry when he saw stories of a few unlucky officers supposedly shooting unarmed black men out of hate and nothing else. So he decided all cops are evil racists and opened fire on a group at an anti-police protest. Five officers were killed, 9 injured, and 2 civilians were also injured. He then ran onto a college campus where countless more could have been hurt. This is not social justice. This is domestic terrorism.

2019-11-15T23:37:04,"Don’t me wrong, I’m definitely gonna see this movie cause it’s looks super interesting, but  as black girl I’m so tired of having every all black cast movie about racism. The great thing about Black Panther was how it didn’t at all focus on black people being less privileged it gave us a reason to be proud of who we are. Not saying these movies don’t, but they just constantly remind us of our struggles. Can’t we ever have a movie about our achievements too? Like what every happened those late 90s/early 2000s black films and sitcoms? I need more stuff like Coming to America, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Brown Sugar anything like that.  Edit: OMG people are so annoying. I never said that movies like this should stop being made. I think it’s very important to make sure that people will understand the harsh reality of our world and what black folks will always have to go through. But I feel like there aren’t enough movies that aren’t about what black folks go through. So no I don’t want any less racism films. Take “Us” by Jordan Peele as an example. The main cast was all dark skinned and not once did it mention racism. Like the only time dark-skinned people (especially women) are starring lead roles it’s always a movie about racism.

This premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case: John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529. The Court stated: “Where the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be murder in the first case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been committed.”  “An arrest made with a defective warrant, or one issued without affidavit, or one that fails to allege a crime is within jurisdiction, and one who is being arrested, may resist arrest and break away. lf the arresting officer is killed by one who is so resisting, the killing will be no more than an involuntary manslaughter.” Housh v.

2020-04-18T03:31:10,"From the time that the cop was shot till the end of the movie I was disappointed. I feel like there were things happening that just didn’t make sense and were illogical. For example, I get that turning themselves in would be practically suicide because of the possibility Of being sentenced to die but who would run anyway? If you kill a cop AND you’re black you’re for sure either getting popped or sent to prison. If you’re black then it’s damned if you do damned if you don’t that’s the real sad truth. I didn’t understand queens logic at all and it ruined the movie for me. So basically they went through all of that to be killed anyway? Yeah...no🤨",0,0,Mercurial,Ip3iE416WxE,-0.25555555555555554,2020-04-18 03:31:10,False,False

I never comment on movies i did not like, but after watching this i just had to, they keep risking their life for some (not even slightly cool, cringe) stuff... Coz they wanted to ""feel their freedom""? Bro, when you run away you can taste all the freedom you want, but don't fuck around while running from cops, for me this all was nonsense..
