I heard he read accident reports in his freetime to learn from people's mistakes and become a better pilot. He knew the first 10 minutes after rotating of the ground is the most dangerous situation to be in. I'd say a vast majority of plane incidents happen within a half mile to a mile from the airport. I can guarantee he thought about landing in the Hudson hours before the flight, not intentionally, but to be prepared if his engines were to die.

Was possibly trying to hitch a free ride and hid in the plane's wheel well. Sad thing is, that upon Sully's landing approach the wheel well was lower to create drag and slow the aircraft down. The homeless man knocked out by the impact drowned in the wheel well and then sank to the bottom of the Hudson due to his heavy back filled with water (for the ride) and a few pounds of change he acquired at the airport through begging.

Woe to all the wicked who do not repent in time. There will be no mercy without true remorseful repentance. It is not My will that anyone perish but that all repent to have eternal life but it is up to each and every one to repent, to live your lives worthy and pleasing to Me or bear the consequences. I love and I care for all, I find no pleasure in the death of a sinner.  I am holy and you must all change, be transformed into My likeness, because without holiness no one will see Me. I did not change. The unrighteous will not inherit My everlasting Kingdom. Do not be deceived.  Woe to all those who justify wickedness, who do not only approve of those things that I hate that are an abomination to Me but do them themselves also. I will repay, vengeance is Mine.  Woe to all those who call evil good and good evil, who mock and scoff Me because they have no fear and no reverence for Me for who I really am and for what I am able to do. I am the righteous Judge the only One who is able to throw into hell. Be wise, repent and know Me for real. I will judge each one fairly and justly for your deeds.",0,0,Alayna Jones,mjKEXxO2KNE,0.04748622589531677,2016-07-01 19:01:57,True,True

Must have been the least difficult script to write out of any movie as the majority of the movie is the investigation, which I am sure is so completely structured, intensely written and rehearsed that all they had to do was get a manual for investigating  an aircraft crash to write the script.

I remember all the hullabaloo surrounding the incident, this wasn't that long ago. Sullenberger milked his heroism way too long, when to my mind landing a plane safely in the water is more than tough, but it's kinda the goal in being a fucking pilot. A captain should care about their passengers. I mean, a real hero wouldn't call themselves a hero. For all we know, this story could be a lie. Sullenberger could have been a coward and never told the real story? But it's made by white people, so it's okay to be credulous and not question anything. ""It's just a movie"" Cool, then I should have the freedom to feel it's more jingoist propaganda.  Pilots land planes safely everyday, but everyone feels a plane crashing is never possibility. It is every time you get on one. But the fact it all happened in a sensitive post-9/11 New York makes this even more Heroic American Porn for all the historically uneducated to jerk off to. That's all Sullenberger was to the media, they used his image as a trope, as way to make money and profess how great we are as a nation. Makes me want to puke. This hardly deserves to be a full feature film, as Sullenberger and Eastwood don't have anything real to say other than more patriotic-fetishism nonsense. I get it.

2017-02-23T02:54:56,"This is a very realistic recreation of the ""miracle on the Hudson"" plane ""crash"" and Tom Hanks' portrayal of Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger is probably one of the best parts I've ever seen him play due to his uncanny resemblance to the real hero pilot of that incident.  Much of the plot of the film revolves around the NTSB investigators suggesting that Sully was not a good pilot because he decided to splash down in the Hudson instead of turning around for a landing back at LaGuardia airport or flying over the Teterboro airport in New Jersey.  Such a ruling would have forced him to take early retirement and lose his license to fly commercial airliners. They had computer simulations that ""proved"" that such an emergency landing could be easily done assuming he had a partially functional left engine.  Things looked bad for Scully for a while, but then some facts emerged that the NTSB had been conveniently concealing.  I don't want to spoil this excellent film by revealing them.  But, I'll just say this.  If you are ever on a airliner when all of the engines fail at once, you'll be glad to have Scully at the controls!",0,0,Ken Behrendt,mjKEXxO2KNE,0.11276400367309458,2017-02-23 02:54:56,False,False

United Airlines DID NOT have the globe livery until 2010 when they (unfortunately) merged with Continental airlines. These two United planes should have continental written on the side of it. Yes they did fix this in the movie, BUT IT WAS STILL WRONG! Continental never had any ERJ 170s! They labeled the plane in the movie, Continental Connection, but continental connection only had a fleet of ATR’s and Q400’s (which one had been involved in Colgan Air 3407 [N200WQ]). The second huge mistake was also the American Airlines planes. THE LIVERY THEY WERE WEARING WAS FROM 2013-PRESENT! In 2009 they still wore the Chrome Livery of the silver paint! Everything at LaGuardia is screwed up in the movie. They somehow got the delta planes correct. (Except back then Delta Airlines was going through new livery repaints since 2008. So it would be unrealistic to see no Delta Airlines 2000s colors in the “Deltaflot” livery.
