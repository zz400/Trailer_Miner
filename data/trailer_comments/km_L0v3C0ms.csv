It looks like a run-off-the-mill actioner directed and written by people who have watched Logan too many times (if that's possible). Plus, ""Last Blood"", really ? :D Do they not care about the meaning of the expression ""first blood"", I mean, for what it meant in the movie ?  Secondly, really, Sly ? I don't see how we could be interested in watching him  massacre dozens of NPC in the era of John Wick, Mission: Impossible and The Raid. Act, yes, he's a good actor.

From using it thru the caves in Rambo 1, to the simple scene on the river when he was carving into the wood while talking to the oriental female guide. Les we forget when the little arabic boy wanted it in Rambo 3. The knife had a soul and life of its own. It truly was his co-star and should have remained in the story and in the last scene when he reached his fathers home. A great scene would have been sticking the knife in a dead tree stump or the like when he entered the gate at his dads home. The final shot a closeup of the knife with him walking towards the house. As saying, is this the end or will you be needed again. At the time I had no idea of A Rambo 5, but now the idea of the knife would have been so fitting.

Rambo was never simply a thug, someone tough and deadly, as we see in the last two movies (if you mess with me you are fucked vib etc). for me, since the first film, Rambo was that and them SOME. he was a TRUE HERO ... dont know if you get my idea through... he was  willing to suffer, to sacrifice, to avenge, to save, to protect, and the most important he was doing it all when odds, even the ally is against him, he was missunderstood and unsupported but still struggled for what he considered had to be protected to ANY cost, being it other fellow humans, or an idea of liberty and what a country owns you, he was  A TRUE HERO. I see this film is going to be awesome and entertaining, but I dont see any of that in this plot.  it fails its source material, I am devasted if I have to be as severe as a critic about a franchise we love (I mean I am not a hater I am trying to be constructive) but this is a inferior creation compared to the two original  movies (I have my reserves about the third one). I am sad. I want my old sobering Rambo back. never saw in a  film someone making me feel he was manly while wheeping. he was a completelly upright and corageous human being, I fail to see that is the previous film, and I have the feeling this one will be the same.... there is already steven seagal for the alpha macho thing, I expected more for this ffranchise.",0,0,STARCADER,km_L0v3C0ms,0.06593364197530864,2019-05-30 20:16:18,True,True

But then again this version is the most favorite for everyone else for some reason, even though it's the exact same song with the exact same beat. I wonder why that truly is Rambo people?

2019-06-10T04:46:44,So glad to see that Slyvester is revisiting an old and familiar fan favorite character! 1-3 were always classics!!! I've never really bothered to watch part 4 except for a few bits and pieces but im definitely anticipating the new one! I think about the very first one allll the time!!! I love the beginning of that one when Sherrif teasel starts harrassing Rambo once he gets him in the squad car. My favorite part out of all the Rambo movies ive seen. Fine performance by Brian dennehy!!!! And i hope this new one can capture the magic of the first Rambo film as well as part 2 and 3.,0,0,Yul Johnson,km_L0v3C0ms,0.3577722537878788,2019-06-10 04:46:44,True,True

Stallone should have directed 1 or 2 Rambo prequels instead.  Would've enhanced this story so much more.  Just seeing this preview I can tell you how the story goes.  You're better than this one Stallone.  Then again, doing a mentorship type story would've drawn more ire than this.  Do a prequel.  Hell, you could get a good 2 movies out of it if the first one concentrated on the character (high school drifter, late 60's American culture, then getting drafted) and just end it with Rambo graduating from the Q course and donning his beret.

2019-06-24T15:33:54,"I used to be a huge Sylvester Stallone fan.  Like most people in today's 'modern' society -actors or otherwise- 'Sly' has long, long, long since become UBER-washed up and completely lost it.  Like far too many people, he has become so stupid that he hasn't realized that he has become a 'self-parody' and has lost all creativity and talent he used to have.    Rambo 1, 2, and 3 were all very good movies.  In my opinion, the best of these movies and easily the most 'underrated' is Rambo 3 (1988).  The self-titled 'Rambo' (officially Rambo 4) released not many years ago was utterly beyond graphic and uber-vile -completely 'unwatcheable.'  A terrible, terrible, terrible movie.  The 'Expendable' movie series are some of the worst most talentless movies I have ever seen.  All actors that star in these movies (Jet Li, etc. etc.) were completely washed up; these movies suck.  The movie, 'Rocky Balboa' (officially the '6th' in the series) -though lauded by public and critic alike- in my opinion sucked beyond belief: It is a far worse movie than Rocky V.  Stallone and Paulie were completely washed up; the movie felt completely 'lifeless,' purposeless and dead.  I never bothered to watch the newest 'Creed' movies as a result.  Now Stallone in his 70s (?) is releasing yet ANOTHER Rambo film?  I would be shocked if it too didn't SUCK BEYOND ALL comprehension like so many modern (i.e., esp. movies of the 2000s to the present) films do.  Very appalling, pathetic, and sad to see that the overwhelming majority of people don't recognize that UNintelligence talentless-NESS exists everywhere in modern society -esp. movies these days.....",0,1,Yih Dzelonh,km_L0v3C0ms,-0.03619658119658119,2019-06-24 15:33:54,True,True

That being said Stallone has stayed true to his fans and kept things non-political and given the fans what they WANT and not what liberal directors and writers try to tell fans what ""they really want"" or what the directors or writers want them to have. Supply and demand, we are customers! Arnold unfortunately seems to either want to fight with and bash President Trump or contribute to liberal agenda crap! We're all entitled to believe what we want or have the political views we want. I am a Bible Believing Christian and a Trump supporter. To each their own but I don't apologize for my BIble Believing Christian beliefs or for my support for President Trump and I don't ask for permission for them either. Neither should an atheist or Bernie supporter apologize to me. When it comes to movies we want to be ENTERTAINED! Not have agendas shoved down our throats. I'm one of the biggest Rambo and Terminator fans out there and I'm very excited about Rambo Last Blood, but I'm not at all excited about Terminator Dark Fate. I'm actually finding that I'm rooting against it because of the evident killing off of John Conner and ""wamen power"" crap of making this new Dani Ramos woman the new leader. It's a political crap move in the shape of Ghostbusters 2016.  I'm all for women hero's but create an awesome one for them, like Wonderwoman, Zena Warrior Princess or She-Ra (i like all three),don't gender swap Terminator and get mad at fans for not liking it.

Watch as he repels borders against telemarketers telling them he is their worst nightmare. He once escaped near death by way of the toilet water now he wonders if he will make to the toilet on time while he is near death. And dont miss the excitement of ancient Rambo being startled by the grandfather clock and instantly shooting it a full minute later. You will be grasped by the wonder does ancient Rambo wear diapers , it depends but probably as he seems to have never needed a bathroom.

To be honest, I was surprised they went the route they did with her dying. I don't know why but I was really expecting her to live. However, it kinda made the movie that much better because it gave Rambo an opportunity to show his badass self with vengeance. The movie was a good movie, however, the last 20-30 minutes was just awesome.  I'm a woman and the majority of women I know don't enjoy the blood and fighting but those are my fave kinds of movies!  I grew up watching all the Rambo movies with my dad and the Terminator movies too, which we're also about to see more of and I'm pumped about that as well!  The only thing that would've made this movie better is if my dad had been able to watch it with me. I asked him but he's a really sick man now and I'm busy with three kids. Plus, we live an hour and a half apart(not too far I know but it feels like an eternity considering how busy I stay)so we just didn't make it happen and I went ahead and watched it by myself without him. I don't have anyone in my life who really enjoys movies like this the way I do.

2019-12-19T00:42:21,"This latest edition in the Rambo franchise of films could have & should have been so much better & though I don't agree with the negative comments of all those so called "" Professional "" Critic's, I do on the other had believe that the last outing of Rambo should've been the last with Rambo with John J finally heading home & trying to move on in life in Rambo 2008...  The original character of Rambo was a study of what war does at destroying the human soul all the while trying to find a way to move on & act accordingly but along the way Rambo was turned into an un-killable killing machine akin to The Terminator but then again it was the 80's & though the first movie was made at the beginning of the 80s & was a well thought out restrained script of a ex Vietnam War Veteran eventually returning home to a country that didnt want to know about or even speak about what happened during the Vetnam War, with veterans returning home & being treated like low lifes but everything after the beginning of the 80's had to be way over the top but I at least could follow the character of Rambo in Part 2 as there is more than a hint of truth in that the US Government reneged on their promise to pay for the release of the remaining POW's after the Vietnam War but by the time Rambo First Blood Part 2 had come along it made no sense for any country to still hold on to prisoners of war for many political & logistical reasons but you could leave your brain at the door & believe that Rambo (unbeknownst to those that sent him) would succeed in finding any evidence at all of POW's still being kept in captivity...  I'm not being critical of this latest film but more on Sly Stallone himself & Why he felt it necessary to do another Rambo movie!..  Yes he has always written the character of Rambo to be involved in subject matter that was relevant of the those present times & with the ongoing idiot that is Trump (who I refuse to call President) & his idea of building a Wall akin to the Berlin Wall in a pathetic & racist attempt at stopping illegal immigrants  from entering the USA but no mention from his administration of how to stop the ongoing constant illegal smuggling of drugs & human trafficking in a once beautiful country that was Mexico but has fast become like Columbia & Cuba & to me this is why Sly picked this particular subject matter as a way in to use Rambo as the brutal avenger who won't stop until every last bad guy has been slaughtered in a barbaric way...  Now don't get me wrong as I also move with the times & with the last Rambo movie we actually got to see the real carnage for the first time in a Rambo movie & it didn't shy away from the effects that these WMD's can cause & if a Pistol with interchangeable Magazines or an AK47 isn't classed as a weapon of mass destruction then I don't know what is & in the last outing of Rambo every bullet that was fired most often than not showed the viewer the damage & carnage it/they can do...  So it's not as if we the viewers haven't truly seen this within one of Sly's movies & if ever there was a character that you would see this happening with it would've been with Rambo John J...  My point!.. Well my point is every Rambo movie has showed the damage war & weapons can do to human body & mind but especially visually we the viewers got to see the carnage such weapons can cause in the  last Rambo movie in 2008...  Plus they made sure that within the scripts narrative that the character of Rambo had finally come to accept what he is & that he needs to come to terms with the fact that's there's no turning back or turning it off...  A point that was poignantly made in the best (In my opinion) Rambo movie Sly has made & that was the first Rambo First Blood & I'd easily put that up there with The Deer Hunter/Platoon & Apocalypse Now for showing us the viewer what war & doing one's duty in service of one's country can do to even the most battle hardened soldier's...  So with 4 Rambo movies already released why another Rambo movie!.. Only Sly can answer that one as even the character of Barney Ross in The Expendables could've covered this story that's in Rambo Last Blood & made it as brutally realistic as the first in that franchise of films...  Anyone else notice that when the first Expendables was a hit the other 2 follow ups were not R Rated & were watered down versions of the first movie...  They were still enjoyable follow ups but to drop out of the R Ratings smacked of pure bums on seats capitalism & I'm not having a go at Sly here either but come on he must've known that by sticking with the exact same gore template as the first Expendables movie would not have damaged sales of this film in cinema's & if anything when I & my friend say The Expendables 2 & 3 we were let down because we're grown men & Sly was making the first Expendables movie for those who grew up on the 70's/80s  onwards films that didn't really show show true brutal violence on screen & the first Expendables film was also a Thank You to fans of those movies...  To briefly finish & sumerise a Rambo movie that somehow just didn't gell even though it had all the realistic gore of the previous Rambo movie that was rightly praised...  For me it wasn't the subject matter as I've seen it done better with 1 film that has had 2 successful outtings  like "" Sicario "" & "" Sicario Day Of Soldado ""  Not the worst Rambo movie by no means but not the best send off either & I think Sly should've left this character alone in Rambo 2008...

2020-02-17T19:08:45,"""Rambo: Last Blood"" is historic. It is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen from Sylvester Stallone. ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is dark, sad and full of over the top dumb violence. By ""dumb violence"" I mean violence that has no art to it just wants to be gory and shocking. I hear this movie is going to be up for multiple Razzie awards.   Here's what I wanted to see the last Rambo movie to be like. Rambo goes to congress to testify before the US House of Representatives on the effects of PTSD and what it did to his life. At the hearings, one of the congress members is Rambo's old nemesis Sheriff Teasle is now a member of congress. Then of course a terrorist group launches a major attack , taking over the US House and holds the congress members hostage. Then of course Rambo escapes and runs around taking out the army of terrorists one by one, two by two and three by three.    It's a lot better plot that Rambo: Last Blood.
