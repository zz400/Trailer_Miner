You will see all the things that were left out or cut, and you will hate it for those omissions. You will notice all of the parts that were changed, and you will be blinded by anger.  And in doing so, you could be missing out on a really good film.  Going the other way - start with movie and then read the book - results in you being able to appreciate both stories. You will like the movie (assuming it was good in the first place), but you will also like all of the extra and different stuff you get from the book.  So if you have already read the book, I am sorry, you probably won't be able to enjoy the movie.

No need to communicate as they would have already seen the speech patterns.   This is why I hate when I see space movies with humans going to different planets. No human will exist when that happens. If they do they will be accompanied with supercomputers that can transform the language for them.   Please make something logical...  Anything intellgent enough will know wtf a gun is.   I mean every time they make fkin movies its like they are trying to communicate with HARAMBE... please stop..  When aliens come WE ARE THE IDIOTS NOT THEM...   Also I am sick and fkin tired of these alien movies that say they come to earth for ""resources"" SO FKIN STUPID.   We will NEVER NEED AN EARTH 2.0 in the future.

An alien species able to traverse interstellar distances and with superior technology would not deal in such a difficult and clandestine fashion. They wouldn't have issues communicating or wait for humans to make every move. The aliens in this movie act retarded. Mostly though this film reinforces the American notion that 'the other' is so vastly different that communication and understanding is near impossible. Aliens with these capabilities would not need a person to hold up a white board and teach them the English alphabet. They'd just link to the net and learn it before they even set foot on the planet.

2016-09-03T03:37:44,"Heptapod B: Language of Gestalts""Story of Your Life"" proceeds contrapuntally, alternating between two storylines from the life of Louise Banks, a linguistics professor. Its characters are all racially unmarked. The first storyline recounts, in no particular chronological order, episodes from Louise's sometimes rocky relationship with her daughter, who we soon learn has died at age twenty-five in a rock-climbing accident. The second focuses on Louise and her partner Gary, a physicist and eventually the father of her daughter, both of whom are commissioned by the US military to learn the language of a race of aliens, which Gary calls ""heptapods"" on account of their seven limbs.   The two cultures suffuse both storylines. In regard to Louise's daughter's choice of profession, it becomes an intergenerational agon:  ...after graduation, you'll be heading for a job as a financial analyst. I won't understand what you do there, I won't even understand your fascination with money ... I would prefer it if you'd pursue something without regard for its monetary rewards, but I'll have no complaints. My own mother could never understand why I couldn't just be a high school English teacher. You'll do what makes you happy, and that'll be all I ask for. (112-3) Even as Louise offers the opposite of the pragmatic emphasis that leads to Asian American occupational segregation, the juxtaposition of ""financial analyst"" to ""English teacher"" creates a contrast drawn in no small part from a post-1965 modality of the two cultures conflict.  The second storyline engages the rigorous scientific description and extrapolation of ""hard"" SF, focusing occasionally on principles from physics, but mainly on techniques in linguistics for ""monolingual discovery,"" or the learning of a language between subjects who do not share a mediating language. The story thus thematizes the two cultures as an opposition between the ""soft"" and ""hard"" sciences. Along these lines, despite Louise's practice of scientific linguistics, she is coded as being on the other side of a cultural divide from the ""hard"" science of physics. At one point, Gary confesses to her that he had given up trying to learn Heptapod: ""I'm just no good at languages."" To which she replies, ""I suppose that's fair; I have to admit, I've given up on trying to learn the mathematics"" (124). In regard to genre, Chiang's choice of linguistics as the focus of a ""hard"" SF story is an unusual one, since the field is, both within and outside of SF circles, stereotyped as a ""soft"" science. ""Hard"" SF is concerned with ""the form of imaginative literature that uses either established or carefully extrapolated science as its backbone.""44 What makes Chiang's treatment of linguistics align with ""hard"" SF is the rigor and intricacy with which he develops Heptapod B, as well as the laws of physics he uses to analogize certain aspects of it.45 Chiang's generic revision of the ""soft"" SF of linguistics as a ""hard"" SF extrapolation is one indication of his overarching concern with achieving a formal resolution to the two cultures conflict.46 Indeed, the very title of the story—""Story of Your Life""—casts everything that follows in this light by gesturing at the essence of the liberal arts.   The heptapod storyline becomes a vehicle for two thought experiments. The first posits a time-symmetrical language whose users possess a ""simultaneous,"" as opposed to ""sequential,"" consciousness that perceives all points in time at once, past, present, and future: a mode of consciousness appropriate to what philosophers of science call ""block time"" or the ""block universe theory."" A version of this theory is presented by the Time Traveller in H. G. Wells's The Time Machine: ""Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.""47 As we will see, this theory is crucial to the story's postracial aesthetics.   The second thought experiment considers how this language might affect a sequential human consciousness vis-à-vis the theory of linguistic relativity. Also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, this theory speculates that ""The structure and lexicon of one's language influences how one perceives and conceptualizes the world, and they do so in a systematic way.""48 ""Story of Your Life"" thus develops one of the prevailing interests in Chiang's work, the linguistic mediation of scientific reason and reality. In ""The Evolution of Human Science,"" human scientists must decide how to interpret the impenetrable scientific research produced by super-intelligent ""metahumans,"" so they begin developing techniques of ""textual hermeneutics."" ""Seventy-Two Letters"" poses the theory that ""there [is] a lexical universe as well as a physical one, and bringing an object together with a compatible name [causes] the latent potentialities of both to be realized.""49 The narrator of ""The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling"" observes, ""We don't normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.""50 As we will see below, ""Understand"" centers on the novum of a language of gestalts and is in many ways an apprentice work to ""Story of Your Life."" For Chiang, the technologization of language is often a conduit for considerations of difference: intergenerational, racial, professional, etc.51   Upon arrival, the heptapods themselves remain in orbit, but they deploy one hundred and twelve wall-sized ""looking glasses"" to various sites on Earth to serve as two-way videoconferencing screens. Louise and Gary begin holding virtual meetings with the heptapods, who are patient and cooperative in teaching them their spoken and written languages, which Louise designates Heptapod A and B, respectively. These languages, Louise soon comes to realize, are completely separate: B is not ""glottographic"" like human writing, because it ""conveys meaning without reference to speech"" (108). Faced with the problem of how to categorize Heptapod B, Louise rejects the categories of logograms and ideograms, which appear to be obvious analogues. She disqualifies ""logogram"" because it implies a corresponding spoken word, and ""ideogram"" for the somewhat cryptic reason of ""how it had been used in the past"" (111). She settles on ""semagrams,"" since the sentences of Heptapod B operate according to their own grammar and syntax. They look ""almost like mandalas,"" she explains: the large, intricate, circular images representing the totality of the universe in Buddhist cosmology:  When a Heptapod B sentence grew fairly sizable, its visual impact was remarkable. If I wasn't trying to decipher it, the writing looked like fanciful praying mantids drawn in a cursive style, all clinging to each other to form an Escheresque lattice, each slightly different in its stance. And the biggest sentences had an effect similar to that of psychedelic posters: sometimes eye-watering, sometimes hypnotic.

This film seems to somewhat accurately depict what could actually happen if someone made contact with us.

I totally get how her knowing the future in her mind, time was not linear in the sense of taking that future knowledge and applying it to their present dilemma to change the outcome of the present and thus alter the future (in the case of those alien vs. human conflicts in the trailers which never actually happen in the movie!!).   So, no for me, the shallow concept didn't fly.  And I was left feeling duped just like after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project"".   My philosophical entertainment isn't so easily satiated by an old cliche with a new twist and a big name Hollywood star carrying the success of the movie on her back.

This movie is more about building tension and character development. Elements of war are undertones throughout the movie, but that's not what the movie is about despite the trailer conveying that idea. Every scene is a visual masterpiece, well acted, and the soundtrack does a really good job at conveying emotion. There is a plot twist at the end that is a bit of a mind bender, but is very subtle in the sense that it really isn't explained to you. You have to pay attention to the whole film and look for clues throughout. Only complaints I have are that some characters were one-dimensional and the bits with the daughter were really cheesy.

And predicting the future? By what? By closing her damn eyes and then some cute flashbacks about her Daughter, about a Chinese man whispering to her ears and she made a phone call repeating the same words and then saved the world. The man also said that he will never forget what she said, oh my, that must be very very SUPER powerful words, but, did they reveal those words to the audience? Guess what? NO. Okay, so you are just acting a movie for yourself to enjoy, is it?If it isn't, prove me wrong please, oh wait , can you even prove anything? You can't even prove what kind of aliens they are, did not explain anything bout how she changed the future( all they had was that phone call) and did not say anything bout the father, nor the daughter, nor herself, just the language(Only shown some drawings). So, tell me, HOW is that so unexpectedly amazing that it can get 8.4? Fucking dumb movie that gets 8.4 imdb due to typical idiots who vote it high just because they think it's so mind blowing. Okay. The movie is constantly showing flashbacks that makes no sense for any plot building or story building, no, none. Not even close. Not shocked to know that who's the father. And after so long watching the movie hoping that it will finally show something that has a POINT, THEN comes the word weapon, makes the soldiers panic blabla. Erm, can I ask, why? And what's the point? You wasted my fucking time learning (or just seeing you people in the move learning) some ink language FOR SO LONG, and then suddenly a word comes up, weapon. Okay. That's sooooo good! 8.4 yay! You deserve this! Oh please for fuck sakes end your miserable and immature thoughts please. And what the hell is with the phone call thing? Yea yea one phone call saves the world and where the hell is the critical moment in the movie? Oh i forgot, it must be that so nervous and very intriguing phone call scene, which took 2 hours to reach that scene, and ends with a hug, with a guy who just confess out of the blue, without any romance building, how's that even close to being touching? No touching scene, boring plot with 80% of movie is about learning the alien's language by drawing and writing numbers on a paper and then programmed it in a computer. Wow, stop wasting money to produce such a stupid movie please, and Words can't describe how much I regret watching this ultimately fucking boring and dumbass shitty movie that I have ever seen in my whole fucking life that made me comment here to show how stupid this movie is how typical these people are to say that this movie is amazing. Please wake up, there are a lot of great movies out there and frankly, this movie is just a piece of shit. Come on, ask yourself. Would you rewatch this movie? Well, unless you wanna go through all those octopus squirting ink and whatsoever flashbacks of a child laughing and running and a fucking dumb woman who uses her mouth to breathe noisy as fuck, (she doesn't know how to breathe through a nose) and spending your precious time watching her drawing symbols on a piece of paper, okay.

Think  Interstellar without anything interesting ever  happening. What ever this movie was trying to impart on the viewer, I  missed it.

Secondly why the hell do aliens care if China and US are talking? If you ask me, it seems we have put our self in center of the universe once again, thinking superior alien races care about human diplomacy and peace on earth.  One last point, was that all it took?

The reason is really quite simple. We have been sending out waves from our radios and tvs for decades and any alien species would come into contact with our broadcasting long before they discover us. Through this they would figure out where we are and as such they would have literally decades to decipher our languages to a level that is at least workable, regardless of what means they personally communicate with.

They should be kept short and intriguing enough.  3. I dont watch trailers to films anymore. Trust me. I watched this movie before I'd seen anything about it. No trailers no nothing. I can tell you now the experience was completely different. From seeing the aliens for the first time, to slowly understanding the plot line as the characters do, to seeing their language signs for the first time not knowing what to expect.

But I love how people on here are saying they weren’t confused about the movie as if seeking assurance and acknowledgment that  they are intelligent 😂. It’s not about weather you understood it or not because it can be very subjective and not trying to be one meaning for all but leaving room for your imagination of how you want to perceive the film. Yes it has one goal, to explain or imply that it’s about communication and altering or not being able to alter, events that will happen because it’s life and life happens in mysterious ways that we as humans still don’t not understand but like to believe that we have the power to do so and that anything we do can affect and cause a chain reaction and repercussions. The movie was clear what it wants you to perceive but leaves room for you to make up your own mind. It doesn’t want you to exactly know what it’s hinting at. That’s up to the vision of the creator/writer and their take. Everyone has a different take on life and meaning and understandings and ultimately in the way we communicate. Just like the title of movie can Imply and be a deep communication to us the importance of the arrival of Louis daughter is to her more than her death (departure). The movie does not clearly reveal or hint at “time travel” or understanding the future past or present for that matter but left to the viewer to interpret what it’s revealing just as the aliens are trying and wanting humans to do. Maybe that is the artistic metaphor and deep meaning of the movie and it’s goal. To have the viewers try to decipher the film as the characters. If the movie was sooo clear as many on here state it was and feel they are sooo intelligent, then why did you come to this section in commentary and look up videos of “ending explained” in the first place? I bet it was to reassure themselves because they second guessed the endings meanings. Because the film was not clear and it was intentional in the first place!!! But that’s just my opinion. I feel the overall movies message was communication within humanity is essential. We may all be divided by location but we should not be with our understanding, our ideals, morals. How our initial impulse is to mistrust anything as not have hope or the right impulse to understand...come together. While humans themselves as intelligent as we are and have the gift to be able to be and mend many problems are so incompetent in the end and will be instrumental in the cause of the end of us and the world. After all, we are only humans.Just as Louis sketches the word and is significant.

Like the alien ship inspired by the rectangle ship in Stanley Kubricks alien film. And I didn’t analyze certain things in the film that were hidden meanings or short reveals inspired by things like the tentacles of the aliens being the star symbol for power, communication etc and the ink circles being like the snake circle symbol about life and death and the ships shape being like an eye concave/convex or like a contact lens possibly implying “eye” as in open your eyes humans...and then open your minds then open your hearts.

The first hour was really cool and I was pretty hooked on the whole concept of establishing communication with the aliens, but the second half was extremely boring. I figured out the plot twist a long time before it happened; hints were being dropped left and right. A good plot twist is one that catches you off guard, or at least isn't so obvious that it erases any other possible scenarios from your mind. But this twist was so obvious that if you didn't figure it out a half hour before the movie executed it, you just weren't paying attention. Seriously, the entire second half was just ""yea saw that coming... uh huh... yep knew it"". By time the twist actually happened I was already over it, which was disappointing because the first half had me really excited. I just feel it was made too obvious.   To the guy in the comments who compared this to Interstellar, predictability is what separates them and makes Interstellar a much better movie, not necessarily the visuals.

2019-06-08T20:02:20,"The movie questions our linear concept of time, this business of starting from the beginning and stopping at the end. But what if time could be bent, shaped, moulded, to fit our purpose? If we could make choices about the present from the future and feel the impact of future choices in the present? This amorphous, flexible nature of time.  Hence, in keeping with this theme, the movie doesn't have a strictly linear sequence of events - all are beautifully and complexly juxtaposed, one on the other.  Recognising this requires paying careful attention, as when Louise says to Ian, ""I just realised why my husband left me,"" even though she was speaking to the one who would become that husband; or while in a trance from the future told her daughter (who was yet unborn) that ""her father left because she told him what he wasn't ready to hear""; or when Louise averts a global war due to insights she gained from the future with her now fully-formed ability for time-bending, and many such scenarios peppered throughout this captivating movie.  She doesn't always have the answers even in the future and many times has to fill these blank spaces with updated knowledge from the present; such instances as the identity of her husband, providing her daughter with the answer to a Science question, and how she came about the ability to gain insights from the future. The future gains from the present just as equally as the present profits from the future. It isn't one way, linear; it's cyclical.  Then the denouement, when Louise asks Ian, if knowing how his life will play out, he would change anything. The zinger of a question that makes us consider the security that our linear universe provides - the protection that comes from not knowing, free from the nerve-wracking pressure of deciding present and future fates.",98,6,Akinlabi Omo-Oso,tFMo3UJ4B4g,0.07941176470588235,2019-06-08 20:02:20,False,False

I don't find this movies complicated at all, its just a little bit boring at first and if you don't understand this movie you probably won't enjoy it so i recommend trying to focus at the beginning of the movie.  Cinematography 8.5/10 - it has a very good visual effect.  Storyline 8/10 - you have to be open minded and you will starting to get it near the ending.  Acting 9.5/10 - i mean it's jeremy runner what can i say.  Realistic 9/10 - well it definitely has some real science in there and it realistically depicted what an alien might actually be like.  Overall 8/10 - i love movies like this it takes on a different approach and i love creativity no none cliche storyline that is illogical and make you go like 'this is stupidity'.

To start with it's 'dumb' because the alien egg-shaped ship opens its door and the dumb people in the story, without a second thought, climb aboard to explore regardless of any imagined danger. There's that patronising aspect, often sugaring USA film scripts, in having a female front-up as the one who knows and understands with her womanly intuition what to do with ugly alien octopuses that wave tentacles about and squirt ink. I clicked through the dvd rapidly just to get the gist and have the film over and done with. No problem as I bought the dvd secured unused in its cellophane wrapper for £3 in a charity shop in the UK. Glad, at least, I helped charity. I mean - honestly - don't bother with this movie.
