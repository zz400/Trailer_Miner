Her (I'm assuming) bodyguard, also, wants the Purge gone. She's in deep trouble when this year's Purge is on it's way because most of the population wants her gone. Her bodyguard hires a shit tone of protection... BUT OH WAIT! TRAITOR! Our two protagonists are now chased by a paid mercenary working for the government in place at the moment. A lot of unnecessary killings and jump scares happen until a group of good samaritans, who are poor people that work at some sort of gas station or convenience store, decide to help them. We have hope! She's going to be okay! NOPE. Car accident! She gets kidnapped by the government and she's brought to this shady cult-like church where they're going to torture her. She's going to die for sure, we saw her bodyguard and the godd samaritans hurt and probably some of 'em killed to spice the story. It's literally impossible that they come help h-.. Oh. They're here. A massive war starts in the church between the ,maybe, 5 people trying to help her and a hundred old people that are going to have guns hidden under their seats. Somehow the good guys win, until, the big boss(president) is not really dead and pulls her from the group with a knife on her throat. Unneccessary dialogue between the bodyguard and the president until, someone (a likeable supporting character) we thought was dead is not really dead and somehow found his way to this shady church kills the president from behind.  She went on to become president of the United States of 'Murica and she puts an end to the Purge and a trilogy of movies.

All of the safe camps have there own 'special rules' to predict survivability. This one particular camp gives everyone a random number and a computer randomly selects two numbers that 'bond' during the purge. Whoever you are bonded to you must be handcuffed to them and survive together in the camp throughout the purge.  The handcuffs have a decent length chain between two bodies to allow minimum freedom but enough privacy. There are no weapons in the camps (except smuggled weapons) and at least 20% of the community are pro-purge. This would give the purgers the struggle of killing, knowing they would have to drag a body around and be instantly accused or in the other hand could be used by the purgers to play mind games with the community.   I could imagine this being pretty interesting, having at least one duo pro-purge and watching civilians having to drag bodies around or attempting to discard of them as they try escape the purge.

Both ways it goes bad for the economy, govt, people, etc. Another thing is that the people which will be forced to participate in the purge will most likely be part of the low class-middle class people.

This in itself proves Jesus is the way and that the world will end soon, don't believe me? Read the book of revelations, He's hated so much in this world, especially America. I pray God has mercy on this world but His wrath is long overdue. There's still time to seek the truth because He loves us so much and sees us as worthy and will cleanse us with the blood of Jesus and He still gives us mercy so turn before it's too late.

I know you might find this funny, but I had a dream about Elizabeth and it was like this..  I was sitting on a table in a restaurant and suddenly I saw Elizabeth  and her son sitting on a table alone eating ice cream and laughing.. I  was shocked for seeing her, my dream, the woman I wanna make an  interview with sitting right there in front of me, then she looked at me  staring at her and I looked the other way because I was shy, then she  sent her son and he invited me to sit with them on their table.  he took my hand and we went to their table and then I met her... she was  like an angel looking at me.. then she noticed a pen in my hand and a  book and some papers.. she seemed interested in what I do, she asked me :  What are you writing? a book. I replied. she was surprised because you  don't see a 15 year old boy writing a book every day. she asked me: what  is your book talking about? I answered : my life.. she read some of it  and I saw her tears falling on her cheek and she said to me : that's  your life story? I said yes and that's my reality and I'm sorry for  making you cry... I had written that book with my tears and put all my  feelings in it.. after she finished reading a part of my book she hugged  me and told me : I'm sorry for what you've been through.. time passed  and we were talking non stop and having fun and I felt this dream like  it was real.. then she receieved a phone call and told me I'm sorry and I  wish I could spend more time with you... you're very talanted and kind  and the last thing she said when she was leaving was..Find me...I said  how?
