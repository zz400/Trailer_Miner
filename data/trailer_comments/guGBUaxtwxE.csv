Then it appeared like it was going to be one of those hostage type of films where the kidnapper is trying to make everything seem like one, big happy family while all the captive can think about is waiting for the right time to escape.  But then, at the last moment, it seems like it may turn into a monster movie related to the hit found-footage movie Cloverfield.  Please don't quote me on that last part.  It may not be the case that the movie is based on Cloverfield.  I didn't care too much for the beginning, and the lack of information and showing of anything has me concerned.  But I must admit that it did take a turn for the better at the end and even though we didn't see anything, I am a bit excited about this because I thought that Cloverfield was a good movie and wanted to see more if this is in fact a movie about Cloverfield.",74,5,Gears Starting,guGBUaxtwxE,0.3079081632653061,2016-01-16 02:43:38,True,True

2016-01-18T06:31:33,"Couple things I noticed (and thus speculated) about this trailer/movie --  - Most (or all) of the movie will take place inside the bunker. (Enough footage is shown in this trailer to identify radical changes in the relationships between the characters, thus indicating a significant amount of time is spent developing and explaining why this happens).  - Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character will be injured prior to the movie's start. (The clip at 0:50 shows her using a crutch and looking curiously at the exit, indicating she's unfamiliar with it. One can therefore assume this takes place before everything goes to shit between her and John Goodman's character and that a good deal of time passes between now and then since she appears quite healthy as she tries to escape.) Also, the very brief clip at 0:32 of the handcuffs includes the limb attached to it -- a limb which appears to be wrapped in a cast or gauze of some sort. This may be in order to dissuade Winstead of trying to leave while in such an injured state. Finally, the clip at 0:43 shows her on what seems to be the same bed with a brace around her leg.  - The fire might not be accidental. (At 0:47 you can see a barrel of flammable liquid being used in some way by Goodman. Goodman's glare at Gallagher Jr's character indicates a possible disagreement on its usage. The same [most likely] fluid is seen to be the catalyst in the fire also seen in the trailer, indicating either improper usage or sabotage.)   - John Goodman's character is crazy. (This might be pretty obvious to some people, although it's still pure speculation regarding his character. The only interactions between Goodman's character and the other two in this trailer show both Winstead and Gallagher Jr. with stressed, worried, or unhappy faces, while the clips of them without Goodman have much more relaxed and passive body language in comparison. The clip at 0:24 makes me think he's making them watch/keep him company as he has fun doing whatever he's doing. Maybe he's some survivalist SHTF enthusiast that's been preparing for this for so long that he's actually a little freaked out that it's happening, or that he's stressing about not being as completely set as he thought since he appears to be having some kind of breakdown at 0:36. I would be disappointed if Goodman's character turned out to be another Harlan Ogilvy from War of the Worlds, but I think there is more depth to him than that, and that he won't be just inherently psychotic because the plot needed a bad guy.)  - Finally, something really minor, but Winstead's character is sharpening a stick with a key at 0:45. This leads me to speculate that whatever she's defending herself from has already ruled out using something more convenient like Goodman's handgun or a sharp knife from the kitchen. Maybe Goodman would realize if a knife went missing or the weight of his holster without the gun?  I've probably definitely missed some stuff, but it's 7AM and I've been up all night. :) What do you think?",4,0,Julsmul,guGBUaxtwxE,0.037540584415584416,2016-01-18 06:31:33,True,True

My theory that after her car accident, the old man and the other guy, abduct her and lie about the chemical contamination and suffered a mental sickness, and just wanted to keep her and treated her as his wife or something. But when she manage to open the door from the shelter, it's revealed that he's actually right, there's a major disaster happening, revolving a unidentified large organism attacking New York City and they just sheltered there during the event. The city has been nuked as an attempt to destroy the Clover and it's parasitic hostile organism, while the Clover succumb from the attack, the smaller organisms survived and now roaming the devastated city. And thus giving a meaning to the film's tagline ""Monsters come in many forms"" referring to both the old man(who keep her from discovering the truth and trying to lock her up just because he has an mental illness and the small organisms from the Cloverfield.

2016-02-03T12:54:43,"I really can't wait for this film it looks super intense and creepy! People have been arguing over if this film is really a sequel to CLOVERFIELD or not. I believe it is a sequel or in someway related to the first film, here's a few reasons why: It is produced by J.J Abrams who also produced the first film, J.J said in an interview that the film is a 'blood relative to Cloverfield' so it is in the same universe, from close observation on the posters for both films the colour and texture of the sky is the same and so is the font, the song played on the juke box is 'I think were alone now' which shadows the slogan for the poster for the first film 'SOMETHING HAS FOUND US' along with what John Goodman's character says at the end of the trailer 'Somethings coming', I don't believe that J.J would use the title 'Cloverfield' in the films title if it didn't have anything to do with the first film as in a way that would be false advertising, The original 2008 movie gave us Tagruato, a drilling company which has a station near New York destroyed just before the events of Cloverfield take place, whose website was part of the original viral campaign. The fake company’s website fired up again recently, sending out e-mails from Vanessa Gwon “Employee of the Month: January 2016.” J.J kept the first films plot a well kept secret and virtually nothing is known about '10 Cloverfield Lane' other than the films main setting is in a bunker underground.

2018-12-05T12:25:26,"Can there please be a single horror film out there that doesn't force me to stare at gratuitous images of ""hot and sexy"" young women getting naked? So sick of seeing that shit. And of course right at the start, she's gratuitously naked and helplessly tied up, fuck you. How about for a change depict guys like that. Fuck you and your misogynistic bullshit. Make male audiences stare at naked guys' swinging nutsacks instead, see how they like it. Wanna see horror? Here are some swinging nuts every single fucking time. Absolutely hate everything about this movie: of course they create this situation where a barely-legal young anorexically thin woman is just randomly undressed, tied up, and completely controlled by some some man-- where they just have to include this gratuitous scene of her having to go to the bathroom with him around; and he completely controls her and tells her what she can and can't do, where she's completely helpless and has no choice of her own, and is ofc too weak to defend herself. Funny how they didn't decide to put a guy in the position she is in instead of her, where ""of course it's just that he's saving her life."" Fuck your gratuitous sadistic misogynistic fantasies of wanting to completely control ""young sexy naked women."" Funny how the focus is on all of this being done to a ""young sexy naked woman,"" not a guy. Totally by chance and has nothing to do with some fat ugly asshole's fap fantasies. Also I wonder if I'll ever in my life get to see a film about a female where the story doesn't have something to do with rape, abortion, pregnancy, or her being a stripper/prostitute-- because,  you know, no other story can ever happen to a female other than something that ties in to her intimate sexual body parts and her being a sex object.",1,0,Rainy Jane,guGBUaxtwxE,-0.056865079365079334,2018-12-05 12:25:26,False,False
