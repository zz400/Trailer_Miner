Not everything was a classic, but they all had great levels of passion and surprisingly complex and universal morals.  All the movies do is just take all of that away and just replace with every family movie cliche meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator (like adding rap songs or Captain Planet straw man villains in The Lorax, or anime references in Horton, or all the needless and painful adult jokes in The Cat of the The Grinch  If you like any of the Dr. Seuss movies and/or are excited to see this one (or not, because just like The Mummy where people will constantly think of the Brendan Fraser one as the original due to the Tom Cruise movie, people will constantly think the Jim Carrey Grinch is the original instead of the Chuck Jones cartoon), that's absolutely fine with me, everyone gets excited over different things.

This was the best writers could think of to be funny or ironic? 8.  the figure skating scene didn't eve make sense- it felt like a short film sequence that went nowhere 9.  the happy song is way too obvious for a grinch movie-WAY TOO on the nose-lazy marketers 10.  watching live action television in a cartoon world?  that's a no.

All three movies they proudly mention are fucking awful.  Seriously, even though I enjoyed Sing as mindless entertainment, I know it's garbage and good god Secret Life of Pets is up their with The good Dinosaur as a bomb fest. I was so angry when I found out all the good and funny scenes were in the trailer. Nice bait.  Did you know that the late Dr. Seusses  wife found The Cat in the Hat with Michael Meyers to be so appaling that she banned any future live action films? Hollywood got around this by making them all CGI.  The Grinch got very mixed reviews (I personally like that movie, because even with the adult humor, the original point was still there even with the added idea of saying the towns people were greedy and the speech about averice.) Not a great movie, but CITH made me angry. The violent humor where he cuts off his tale, the overtly raunchy humor of oogling over the mom just ... no.  The lorax is a joke. Only reason the boy cared was to get in the pants of a girl old enough to be his baby sitter. And in the end, the trees were yet another commodity to oogle at. There was no intrinsic understanding of what the Oncler did and the possibility that maybe the tree in the last seed might never grow. Also the towns people were fine. There was no proverty and no one who could not afford clean air. So there was no actual conflict or reason to need trees.

The Grinch was either born being miserable and depressed or in the live action one at least they tried to give a reason he was that way.  The Grinch also never came down to town.

2018-10-25T21:17:35,"Ok this movie hasn’t even been released yet and I have 3 problems here.  Problem 1. The jokes aren’t funny just stupid. Come on Illumination. You guys wrote the Despicable Me movies. You can be funny. These movies are proof of that.  Problem 2. It’s totally dated with the music and stupid humor. One of the reasons the first movie was such a classic is how timeless it was. If I didn’t know it was from 1966 I would’ve guessed 50s 70s or maybe even the 80s. It could’ve taken place in a number of decades. With this, it screams 2010s. If we looked back at this in 20 or 30 years, we would be able to tell it’s from the 2010s. Being dated doesn’t do any justice to adapt the original book, nor match up to the first movie.  Problem 3. This movie has no reason to exist. We already have 2 movies of this. One was perfect and the other was........not so perfect. What’s the point of making another one when we already have an animated movie that’s perfectly fine? I feel like it’s only being made just to have a CGI version. It’s The Lorax all over again. And we all know how well that turned out.

2018-12-09T11:28:42,"This movie is a total disappointment. Trash. Trash. Trash. Worst: recycled trash. Disney no longer respects its viewers, let alone the source material.   Don’t go see it. Stream it illegally if you want. Either way, It’s a waste of time and money. I can promise you that in one year’s time, you will be seeing the 2000 version over this.   The characters are one dimensional and the same as every other Disney film.   Cindy Low Who? You mean the annoying Despicable Me girl whose kink is a Fluffy Pony—ponytail and all. The Grinch? You mean Mr. “I lost my family, I am an orphan, was a good guy but loneliness made me sad and now I hate everyone and especially Christmas”. No! No! No!   The Grinch’s redemption in the original story had a huge impact because he was mean, not because he was a broken soul who needed the unconditional love from a little girl. Disney neutered the Grinch!! In this story, the Grinch had no balls to be mean. All the evil we ever get from him is in the trailer. Talk about spoiler alert!!!   The Moose? You might be wondering what I am talking about. You get my point.   The Mom and the festive guy who says he is the Grinch’s best friend. Did any of you get trailer trash and stereotypical black guy vibes?   Max. He was good hearted in the original; he is good hearted here. This is the only redeemable quality.  The gang of kids.

2018-12-31T04:14:18,"I feel that this movie was loyal to the book and the original 1966 animated version! They didn't change who the character's were and they didn't change the main plot of the story. Instead, they added more characters to contribute to the good story telling, a proper motivation for not only the grinch, but for the other characters as well, and an entire road of character development! It all made sence! We didn't have an unnecessary love story and we most certainly did not have bad behaving whos and sex jokes. The Grinch was decent, not gross and evil. You can argue that Ted Geisel's Grinch is supposed to be evil, but looking back, The original grinch didn't even interact with the whos! He just hated all the noise they would make. He didn't burn down trees or eat glass. Sure he did abuse his dog, but after his heart grew three sizes bigger, he actually treated his dog fairly! We could see this is the two other books Dr.Seuss wrote tittled ""I am Max"" and ""I am Cindy Lou who"". They happen right after Christmas. Some are mad that they took the abusive aspect away from him, but hey! If Jim Carrey's movie could change and rearrange everything then I'm pretty sure this shouldn't bother most people. I must say the interaction between the Grinch and the animals in this film were quite fun to watch!   In all honesty, Dr.Seuss made one dimensional character's who were only meant to convey a message. Of course I'm not saying Jim Carrey's is bad or you should not like it, but if we are going to start comparing carrey's to Cumberbatch's grinch then we need to set the two beside each other. This movie made sence while the other didn't.   The atmosphere, animation and music we see in this film is simply candy to one's ears and eyes and the comedy was actually funny! This may be the same studio who cursed us with fart jokes in every one of their films like the minions or Sing, but for once it seemed like they actually cared about the quality of their movie! Now that alone deserves to be appreciated.   My only conclusion as to why people didn't enjoy this grinch so much is because it was mostly directed towards a younger audience. It was soft. It didn't have that spark of weirdness. Jim Carrey's had adult jokes and creepy acting which the older audiences enjoyed a lot (12 and up)! It explains why most people found it boring, but bashing on it endlessy for being more decent is unacceptable. It ruins everyone's fun.   I enjoyed this Grinch a lot. It has so much for us to breathe in, yet it's still loyal to Ted Geisel's book and animated short. It's perfect.",0,0,Peach B.,Bf6D-i8YpHg,0.08783637152777779,2018-12-31 04:14:18,False,True

Older ""kids"" films were totally family oriented and had plenty of Easter eggs which went over the kids heads but the parents could laugh at them or the kids would come back one day as adults and laugh at this joke they completely missed when they were little.   Also, anyone else notice how predictable the jokes are in these new age kids films too? This is feels like it's the trailer for every other new age kids film. Pop music, music stop, somebody gets hurt 'it's funny', something cute, something completely random happens it's 'funny'. It's like a blueprint kids film trailer, just change characters and situations and the pop music a bit and here you have the advertisement for another kids film.   Totally bleugh and meh.

Just because they watch it does not mean they like it.  I am so disgusted with the stuff they call music today.  But this is the result of desperate companies who use mixing boards and vibration in these peoples voice to cover up how they really sound...…..crappy.  Bring back the 80's.  That is when music died.  Now all you have is people who sing about love and rappers who have to vibrate their voice because they cannot sing for crap.  Honestly...….listen to it.
