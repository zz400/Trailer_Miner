She some how witness a crime and cant do it alone and try to get help for the cops that do heavier police work but they don't listen or they go out and find nothing a few times and gave up listening to her. She comes across a fox who could be a eye witness the this crime or have some role or have information on the crime. But also notice that he had a warrant for his arrest or she witness a criminal act that he had done (mostly scamming someone) and blackmailed him to help her to find the criminals and bring them in. As they search for clues they fought along the way but later gain respect for each other (maybe after they tell there personal stories) as they closed in they end she wanted to do everything herself but the fox suggested to calling backup. But after going in and trying to take down the bad guys they end up failing and getting captured and out of some reason the hideout gets destroyed and altered the other cops just to find the two and she end up losing her job and (if the fox had a warrant) he would be put into prison. After sometime in depression after losing her job she encourage herself out of some reason and brakes the fox out of jail (of he encourage her to try again out of some reason). and goes out and try again and succeed (the evil boos might be killed or arrested) and then ends up getting her job back. The fox might join the force, walk of into the sunset, or ends up in some relationship with her if they go the romance way.  As for the characters I know the fox and bunny is the main but mostly the fox. As for support characters, I think there is gonna be a kinda of a sidekick for the fox maybe a weasel that helps him with some black-market goods or information. And I'm guessing there might be some connection with him in the movie villain and yes I know there is one, theirs always one. I'm not sure what he is gonna be, as for the cops, many top of the food chain and large and strong animals and I'm guessing the commissioner maybe a Lion. And I'm guessing there might be a scene she heads to her parents house and her mom and dad thought she brought home a boyfriend and she could be living with them to  As for personality goes, the Fox is a scammer with a smooth talk to talk his way out of anything. a smartas* but short sighted.

In the future, the animals evolved from the experiments and became anthro, wore clothes and built civilizations (except unlike Zootopia's animals, they're against technology) but they still have the same flaws that humans had: They separate themselves by species and fight with each other.

But the one thing that Zootopia does different, seems to be the only movie of it's kind to focus a lot on the fact that there are no humans. They're trying to make it seem like They're unique for being aware of this. As if Disney is doing something new, groundbreaking and unheard of.

I can say one thing: It won't make me appreciate Anthro art any less, any more than EQG and AATC 2007 and 2009 made me love chipmunks and ponies any less.  If the story pleases me, then I will praise David Seville, Beatrice Miller and Celestia for a great film.",0,0,TheNotverysocial,g9lmhBYB11U,0.13738636363636364,2015-06-12 06:17:01,True,True

2015-06-12T08:54:08,是一个很古老的传说............ 　　很久很久以前，在老虎王国有一对兄妹，他们各自身怀特殊的能力。 　　哥哥有着一对千里眼，能够看到极远方的微小事物 　　妹妹有着一 对顺风耳，能够听到极其细小的声音他们从小一起长大 .................一起快乐一起悲 　　伤............... 　　闲暇时候，他们总会跑到后山的山丘上， 　　哥哥眺望千里外的遥远国 度，对着妹妹述说着那里各种千奇百怪的事物。 　　妹妹聆听微风传来的讯息，对着哥哥吟唱着远方教堂传来的天使般的歌声。 　　或许是长时间在一起的缘故，他们爱上了彼此。 　　虽然他们知道这段爱情是不被允许的，但他们就是无法控制自己。 　　他们抛开了一切束缚，开始不顾一切地享受着爱情。 　　然而， 纸终究是包不住火的，两人的关系被发现了。 　　父亲大发雷霆，母亲以泪洗面，街坊邻居对两人指指点点，两人拼命证明对彼此纯真的感情。 　　但是，由于道德观念的枷锁，两人终究不被允许，已经无路可走了 　　........... 　　为了证明对彼此至死不渝的爱， 　　哥哥弄瞎了自己的眼睛，妹妹弄聋了自己的耳朵， 　　不为什么，只因为他们认为，既然得不到众人的祝福，那有这能力又有何用？ 　　反正他们两人是得不到幸福的一对。 　　很久很久以后，有个音乐家听到了这个凄美动人的爱情故事，大受感动。 　　百感交集下，他谱出了一曲感人肺腑的曲子 　　我偶然间听到了这曲子，不禁悲从中来。 　　真能令人悲叹兄妹两人可歌可泣的遭遇呢！！ 　　很可惜，我没有它的CD，也没 办法在这里让大家听到它优美的旋律， 　　我只能就我所 记得歌词的部分来和大家分享。 　　希望你们也能体会出其中的感动 .................. 　　歌词是... 　　两只老虎 两只老虎 　　跑得快 跑得快 　　一只没有眼睛 一只没有耳朵 　　真奇怪 真奇怪 我不是水，我是在跟你们讲故事,0,0,极限装逼王,g9lmhBYB11U,0.0,2015-06-12 08:54:08,True,True

First, this isn't a ""furry"" movie; that would be like saying Cat's Don't Dance, Robin Hood, Tail Spin, etc are ""furry"" movies/shows. Furries are a certain type of fan, not the name of the concept of anthropomorphic societies. Now, I certainly don't have a problem with the furry fandom or with them anticipating this movie (I'm not wishing death on them like some of you homicidal people down there).    Second, the idea of an animal only society has existed for a *long* time in movies and children's tales and is not an original concept. Now this doesn't mean Disney can't use this concept as some actually seem to believe; it's certainly not a copyrighted idea. Disney used to use this a lot in the past with it's cartoons so you are being silly acting like because Chicken Little exists means that this movie will be just like it.     Regarding quality, it'll all factor on what story is told and how it's presented.

2015-06-13T00:15:48,"I'll jump on the bandwagon too because I love when people bash furries like me...  This movie is actually pretty adorable. The fox alone has so much expression with just his ears. His shoulders, hands, tail, hips, all scream his emotions with out him having to say a word or even grumble! Animation has come so far and I'm actually kinda excited to see what the story of this movie will be. If there even is a story. It could just be, ""Let's follow a fox through his life in Zootopia.""  Of course, as this is an animated movie with anthropomorphic animals in it, it will attract a huge amount of attention from Furries. We're fans of this schit, what do you expect? Some people will find an erotic niche, some will find a duplication(because replication is a sign of appreciation) niche, and others will enjoy or hate the film for their own reasons.  Some extreme furries might come in with their furry gear and get their furry all over the theater, others might come as generic moviegoers secretly stroking their affinity for anthros. And another chunk of people /will/ be generic movie goers, come to see what the movie has to offer.  News networks, mainly Fox News, will be more than delighted to jump on the ""Let's rip open Furries for being different in a slightly extreme way."" bandwagon and happily rip Furries a new one... Again. Coming up with the obvious, ""Furries have been caught /masturbating/ to the film Zootopia in the theaters... Can you believe it? A bunch of grown men and women in animal costumes are coming to theaters, in public, sitting down and masturbating in front of other people with each other.""  This movie is going to attract a certain kind of people because it meets a certain kind of people's attractions and affinities. It will attract a smaller kind of people as it meets their creative desires and an even smaller amount of people as it meets their creative and sexual needs to replicate and to twist into a sexual light. Its almost guaranteed to make at least some kind of news as it will be very controversial because of the Furry following.  In other words... If you want to watch the movie but you fall ill by the very idea of people enjoying animals so much that they themselves would dress in animals as a way of replicating and appreciating, then sit at home for a month of two. Wait for the movie to come out on DVD or get published all over the internet. it'll be about the same cost or even free. And you can avoid being made ill. Win win if you ask me.  Oh, and yes, more Furries need to learn to take one for the team and mock themselves. If the mockery reaches Furry to Furry levels then it'll become one giant circle jerk and eventually all the mean spirited comments like, ""Furries are the scum of the Earth"" will cease to have really any meaning. It will eventually fight Po's law of shit being done so much as a parody that when things are meant to be a real attempt they won't be seen as real, they'll be seen as more parody.  Sooo...

After a mighty battle with his enemy and a daring rescue of a little girl from radioactive doom, our yet unnamed hero returns to his home, exhausted and a mess...ew...radioactive sweaty super-underwear...atleast it's the outer pair for over his pants. ANYWAY. He casually tosses his dirty clothes in the hamper despite his wife yelling from downstairs to remember his costume goes in the special bin not the regular hamper, and he tiredly staggers off to take a shower. Welllll....when he steps out and goes to find some clean clothes for the evening, the hamper is missing. His wife screams from down stairs and as he rushes awkwardly down the stairs in his towel, he discovers a now LIVING clothes hamper monster trying to eat his wife's oven mit while she tries to wrestle the mit back. The creature panics and escapes, and soon reports of a wandering laundry monster stealing and eatting people's socks pop up all over the neighborhood. People from all walks and groups try to stop the beast, but it keep escaping. A lazy little boy discovers the hamper monster in his backyard, and finds out if he feeds the monster his dirty clothes...he doesn't have to wash them. Ever. So he decides to try and hide it and keep it as a pet, to make cleaning his room easier. Adventure, childhood pet keeping love, drama, and a few tense scenes ensue and in a dramatic battle between the hero hubby in deep doo doo and the hamper monster who mistakenly thinks he has to defend or protect the boy from the hero...the hamper breaks. All smelly missing laundry appears in a massive pile from seemingly out of no where in the middle of the road where the hamper now lay ordinary, plastic, and broken in half. The boy begins to weep. Falling to his knees and bawling, something stirs in the mountain of lost dirty clothes...a pile of baby hamper beasts no bigger than decks of cards leap up and scatter off away. People shriek but the boy is over joyed.

Though Zoophobia is a cool comic and I check up on it weekly myself, I doubt a percentage of people working on this film has ever came across this comic and just figured up a title for the film sort like the author to the comic did. One placed phobia cause the main character is scared of said animals. The other Topia because its a city full of anthros.  I'm super hyped about this film nonetheless and hope it has a great story plot.

Besides, we have cartoons like Mikey Mouse, Looney Tunes and MANY others, where animals are Anthropomorphic. They don't have anything to do with Furry porn.  Seriously, having Animals as main characters has been around forever and I really like that idea. Besides, EVERYTHING has porn. Everything. So shut the hell up.  Anyways, for some reason, I just can't get enough of this trailer, I find myself coming back to it time and time again. The animation is very smooth and the expressions are pretty nice and the concept of the trailer is hilarious, especially with the narrator expressing little to no emotion, and I like the fact that natural enemies don't get along.

2015-06-15T02:02:43,"There's a lot of comments about furries. Having an internet connection and reading though lots of comments and stuff, naturally I am aware of such things. I actually have theory about furries and bronies. I think that everyone has a piece inside of them that is satisfied from social interaction. I think these are people who have for some reason lost the ability for that piece inside of them to be satisfied by other people. But furry and brony characters are characters who are like people, but they are also created to be very accessible to people with underdeveloped socialization, by design. So these characters appeal to these guys. I mean, MLP has a fanbase of people who probably large numbers of them would have trouble being completely comfortable in a normal adult relationship. Just going off the stereotype.. I could be wrong, (but am I) I've seen reviews of mlp, even tried to watch an episode (it was like the time I tried to listen to a Justin Bieber song, I couldn't make it all the way through). But in the case of MLP the characters are essentially candy colored little women (in like .. horse form .. I know .. but still) in a friendly accessible fantasy world, so is it any wonder these characters appeal to them? And since they are probably also repressed when it comes to natural sexuality, is it any wonder there is a rather prominent amount of porn dedicated to the subject as well? To me it seems like it's almost logical that it exists. And I don't really care, there's worse things to be into, it's not something I think it's healthy to be all about, it's not something that I think someone should TRY to be into, but frankly it's like eating a bad diet or playing too much video games, it's harmful to the person, but I don't think it's that harmful to others. The ironic thing is that hostile social environments I think is what ends up shaping people who go into these fanbases in the first place, so people who are angry about weird but probably harmless people are actually the ones who ironically play one of the largest roles in making them. Anyway just my theory, I wonder if I'm right or wrong.",1,0,MrBenny10101,g9lmhBYB11U,0.050347222222222245,2015-06-15 02:02:43,True,True

Because mammals are very accomplished--when it comes to heightened skills and evolution. Ha! Beat that, dinosaurs!) shouldn't it instead, be called: Mammaltopia?    If you see anything but mammals, type it in this corner. Thank you!         Anyways. I hope that the new Disney movies would lay off the ""CG craze"".(CG=computer graphics.) Because, so many movies are into that tiring trend; including our beloved Disney.This person, wants some eye-licious, hand-drawn animation. Right now! Right then! Everything must be balanced. CG may be very realistic looking and all, with the skin and hair and etc. But, kids want more of the old, unrealistic stuff that they saw their parents watched. Classics, like Cinderella, Lion King, and more. Those were the dreams of the past. Even so, CG is not the only thing butting into movies. Oh no. I spied Disney, countless of times; remixing some of their dusty classics in the back of their theme park closet; they have created live actioned movies out of these old tapes/DVDs. Example ( claps hands): oh look! A wild movie, named Cinderella has appeared in theaters! No! Wait! This is not the old one! It's a live actioned one. (Have pity on our future generation, please!)   ----Sorry, though (after taking a deep breath from my crazed dislike rage). Hffff....pffff. So,so,sorry. I've never watched their new live actioned Cinderella movie, at all, never before. I have jumped a great far distance into the jagged conclusions and I've judged a movie that I had never seen before; which is why I criticize a lot, especially when I stood still, watching the trailer with unblinking eyes and desperately, ranting under my breath out loud about my straining thoughts Disney's attempt at trying something new with their oldies.       Many people have serious and silly opinions. Some, may clapped for the film, because of its unique difference to its original counterpart. While others chose to stick their thumbs down and bawl at the monstrosity of the movie, created by lazy film-makers, recycling old movies to obtain some hard cash from this generation's young.

Some of you forget to realize that Disney is responsible for a lot of people to be a furry from Robin Hood to majority of the Disney Afternoon cartoons in the late 1980s through the mid 1990s (Which where I fall under) to everything else. You want to stop the fandom? Build a time machine, go back to before Robin Hood was made before Walt's death and convince him to make sure no movie or cartoon dealing with anthropomorphic animals are never made. Oh? Too lazy to build one? Forgetting Looney Tunes among others also helped make people furries too? Or you just want to continue on that furries will ruin everything which newsflash, those idiotic moronic trolls on 4Chan and others ruin things to get ""lols"" but never take responsibility for their actions so blaming others for their failures is the only way they feel better!

I love seeing Anthropomorphic animals and it will be nice to get a new Antho animal movie that is not the horrible wreck that Chicken Little was. I will look at the comments and see how happy everyone else is.  The comments are filled with tons of unreasonable hate and that really makes me angry. Why are there so many people attacking Furries? They are just people that like seeing the type of animals shown in this teaser. Many people complained ""stupid Furys tink dis movie is 4 dem even tho disney makes dis stuf alot"" I have seen tons of those complaints and no Furries actually saying this movie was made specifically for them. Think logically, why would Disney target such a small audience? The answer is they wouldn't, and most Furries know that.   As for the way this teaser was made, I see no actual mention of Furries so would people just stop bringing them up. 90% of the comments is about Furries even though they were not mentioned at all. Disney would never bring up Furries because that could bring a lot of controversy, and even though that would get them a lot of attention, a lot of it would be bigoted losers that wouldn't watch the movie.",2,0,Sejref Raincisa,g9lmhBYB11U,0.00705492424242424,2015-06-19 19:03:42,True,True

This will make the fandom better, not the Zootopia worse: furries need a legitimate outlet so their image would be less sexual . A huge bit of the fandom is completely harmless and non-pornographic but of course that has no news value. I guess if people learned about anime from 4chan and other weeaboos instead of kids shows like DBZ you'd have the same idea about anime as you have now about the furry fandom. Same goes for comics and cartoons too. My point is, that it's not nearly as bad as you were led to believe.

First: This movie is the perfect opportunity for us to talk like civilized people about our differences, so don't screw this up by defending your postures blindly, be smart and listen. Second: This movie is NOT aimed for furries only, Disney knows that following the furry identity they can get free advertising and hype, because we will talk about this for months, i'm sure. The reason Disney is using anthropomorphic animals as protagonists and giving it so much importance is for the secondary plot, the part about discrimination between species and because kids love animals. Third: Yes, this furry hype will end in a lot of people interested in the furry fandom. You can do nothing about that, you can't sink furries image, you will only expose yourself as a discriminative ignorant by trying it. In conclusion: ignore the fact that furries will love this movie, just stop talking about that. And for the furries, stop saying ""i love this movie because i'm furry"" nobody cares if you are a furry, that's not making you a more interesting person, so shut up about that.

In very much the same way that all fandoms gain their outside image from the worst of the worst (ie. bronies and fat fedora-wearing Hot Topic shoppers), furries gain their recognition from the copious amounts of porn that come from the 0.01% of the community. Sure, there's a few weird grapes in the bunch, but they should definitely not be the main image given to the hundreds of thousands of varying representatives. Of course you're going to hear the worst parts about any fandom; scandalous news sells the most. What you may find, however, is just a bunch of friendly people gathering and sharing the same interests.

Not sure where furry comes into the equation at all, unless we want to call movies like Chicken Little, Disney's Robin Hood, Madagascar, and everything to do with Mickey Mouse furry content as well.

(pushing back to the fifties and further) Including villains, (So many via batman universes ._.) We've also made an insane amount of games/movies/tv shows that use anthropomorphic animals. I will pick some random ones like Alien Soldier, Swat Katz, Street Sharks (love it) compared to the obviously well known ones such as Sonic and TMNT and Looney Tunes. If anything, at the rate these have been pushed out over the years, shouldn't there be a lot more furries than there are since they are almost always in a positive light? What makes it bad?

Reason for piss is I am not 100% sure but they might have taken some minor ideas from a webcomic called zoophobia by a artist called vivziepop and thats been here bit longer before they announce this with concept art while back.  So for ppl reading and wondering what is zoophobia this how it goes. Zoophobia is a hidden city filled with animals and then the 2 similarities are the animals and city are there. What's different is in zoophobia the animals that talk have the ability to shift into human form or cross between that (example deer looks like a boy but with deer ears and some small antlers) or a anthro form of it like shown with characters here. Some humans also exist in this city if chosen to become a resident. Also coexist in the city are demonic and monster like characters but most of them are good and if you read the webcomic it explains how they live together.  Now here is they are all anthro form, no humans, demons and monsters and its target is for kids while zoophobia is a bit 16+ age range (some violence and language in it). So again I am not sure if they took some minor ideas from it but just saying when this gets popular and ppl find out about zoophobia and be idiots saying the artist took ideas from this she didn't. The webcomic was here longer before they release concept art of this movie.  The webcomic and character designs are really good and worth checking out. She even has some videos here and plans to do her own short animated series called hazbin hotel. ",0,0,dungeonmaster16,g9lmhBYB11U,0.1418044077134986,2015-09-22 08:13:35,True,True

Now, i'm not saying that 3D animation is bad or anything but the market is saturated by it and it would be really refreshing to see hand-drawn again... Especially from a giant like Disney that has such a rich history with hand-drawn... I get that some movies will probably look better 3D animated (like Tangled with Rapunzel's hair) but i don't think it is crucial for Zootopia (ok, maybe a little with the fur and all) or especially Moana. I'm worried that Disney has abandoned hand-drawn after the Princess and the Frog flop box-office-wise. In my opinion it looks absolutely stunning and the story and music are amazing! But what can i do? Market and money will always dictate the course of a company, which is why we should support Disney and go to theatres and buy dvds especially when a hand-drawn movie comes out.

2016-02-23T09:17:16,"1. Saw the movie. You should see it too.2. Why does everyone say this is a furry movie? I don't get it. They say that the animals walk on two legs, wear clothes, use technology, act like humans do, and that apparently makes them furries. Y'know what other characters match that exact description? Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Donald, to name a few. Yet I don't see people freaking out over why they are furries, and need to burn and stuff. Now, this part is for the furries. Honestly, I don't get why you do what you do, but hey, if it helps you out in some way, allows you to meet other people with confidence, knock yourself out. I mainly have a problem with the obsessive furries known as ""furfags."" First time I saw this teaser was last year when I saw Inside Out in theaters. The minute the word anthropomorphic came on the screen, I knew the crazy furries would be all over, and that the Zootopia tags on Instagram, Tumblr, etc. would be overflowing with posts mentioning, ""yay a furry movie im so happy"" and I was right. By now, I realize that posting this may or may not start a flame war, but I'm too deep in now. Basically, stop associating this movie with furries or calling this movie a furry movie. It's simply a nice Disney movie for families, with animals that walk and talk, which Disney has been doing before any of you were born. I now await the strongly written replies below.
