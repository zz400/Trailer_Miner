I'd say read the book after seeing the film. If you've read the book keep the constraints of the film length in mind. Despite its flaws this is still a very good film and worth seeing.

For instance in this trailer, the information on the virus was completely unnecessary. Knowing it now, and seeing the rest to follow, I probably won't even want to see this film now....simply because the stupid trailer ruined a huge plot focus/twist, and possibly something crucial that would have caught me off guard.

I was not expecting great or mindblowing experience, but you should never make movie so sterile and borderline epileptic. It is like they shifted into fifth or sixth gear and did not know how to hit  a brake. Performances in the film are mostly fine and actors try their best, but they are constantly bogged down by lousy script and underwhelming character arcs that you just do not care. It is also one of those films that constantly need to explain everything, but when you as an audience member try to connect the spots you realize things just do not make any sense.

This film leads me to question several issues; 1.) Is Tom Hanks getting too old to portray Robert Langdon?  2.) Is Ron Howard slipping as a film director and 3.) Has the Dan Brown mystique worn off?   Easily The Davinci Code scored $77M on opening weekend in 2006. Angels & Demons dropped down to $46M opening weekend in 2009 and Inferno dropped to $15M in 2016...undoubtedly executive at Sony are questioning the viability and future of the franchise. Tom Hank's acting ability is sustainable but, Robert Langdon is a much younger man Hank's 60 years. Ron Howard's films have always paid attention to the overall story line with a focused attention to historical detail, clearly exhibited in both The Davinci Code and Angels & Demons, Inferno failed in both areas. In my opinion, unless there is a stronger commitment to reshape the Dan Brown books-to-film franchise...its not worth pursuing in the future.",0,0,Terrance Hill,RH2BD49sEZI,-0.01148148148148148,2017-04-14 20:21:25,False,False

The account of the creation of living beings is of 6 days. Only a fool will get the simple words wrong or intentionally twist them for self gain and fame. But the even bigger liar was that minister who didn't answer his question (if Dan is telling the truth in which case he is brainless).  ""I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in eighth or ninth grade, I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, 'I don't get it. I read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God created heaven and Earth and the animals in seven days. Which is right?' Unfortunately, the response I got was, 'Nice boys don't ask that question.' A light went off, and I said, 'The Bible doesn't make sense. Science makes much more sense to me.' And I just gravitated away from religion. - Dan Brown",0,0,Prasad J,RH2BD49sEZI,0.09255952380952381,2018-10-01 04:34:18,False,False
