2018-11-20T05:21:58,"(Just had to rewrite this) anyone notice the glitter? Well, i think that maybe there are multiple types of glitter in this movie (at least thats what i would think)  1. Power glitter Power glitter is a powerful source of glitter..and i would think that this stuff is used by queen whatevera wanabe to make there body more stronger, but not in size or anything but more of strengh, because her body is just a blob of some kind..just mass and liquid cells (thats what i would think) and without the power glitter..she pretty much would be nothing, so she feeds on this source to become more stable and be able to shapeshift, but also to power her kingdom. (If you look in that dance party or the introduction clips with queen whatevera wanabe in it, thats what i mean.)  2. Happiness glitter  Notice that clip where everyones happy and dancing and also in front 3 of them are Covered in glitter? Thats the happiness glitter, when put onto ones body it causes them to be happy all the time (no references there please?), there mind is filled with happiness and they will become hyper if not wiped off the body of the person with it on them.  3. Sleepy glitter  This isnt Actually in any of the clips, i thought that one up..but its like an essential dust that causes one to sleep for almost forever unless its wiped off, and apparently i imagined this scenario with one of the characters facing off queen whatevera wanabe (or sweet mayhem) who have this big machine that shoots it out (it used to be lasers but it changed) And well...since its not canon, that maybe wont happen..but if it did, then i wouldnt be suprised.",2,0,Holy Shard,cksYkEzUa7k,0.31607142857142856,2018-11-20 05:21:58,True,True

2018-11-21T03:15:34,"Dear friend, be of good cheer and know that Father God, through Jesus Christ, enables us to stand for Him. You see, courage is needed to stand against evil. Apostle Paul told the church at Ephesus, “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil” (Ephesians 6 : 12).          Clearly this unseen opposition is more than any of us can face alone, so God has given us the necessary spiritual resources (the “full armor of God”) to enable us to “stand against the devil’s schemes” (v. 11).          What might that courageous stand involve? It may be working against injustice or intervening on behalf of someone you know who is vulnerable or victimized. Whatever form the conflict may take, we can have courage—our God has already provided what we need to stand for Him and against evil. Hallelujah, thank you Lord Jesus!         Precious one, it is time to stand for the One whom laid His life down for you in pure love. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and blessed abundantly with love!         May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️",2,5,msdogooder,cksYkEzUa7k,0.0706538170823885,2018-11-21 03:15:34,True,True

2018-11-21T05:51:19,"In Congress, July 4, 1776.  The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

Depression is a no joke. Everyone needs moments of privacy at one point. As for the family in this movie they seem like bunch of idiots who somehow happen to have too much money to burn.

The first Lego movie was great, even though lacked a lot of..i mean a ton of tribute to the 1980's & early 90's lego sets (other than 1 second scenes).  I didn't get into Duplo or Lego friends or lego sets for girls.  This movie seemed to be centered all around Batman and the Duplo Queen...who had theee most annoying, arrogant behavior and voice.  Sounded ghetto.  LM2 lacked yet again a ton of tribute to old sets or themes, except for the one maybe 5 second scene of the 1980's space theme lego sets...of which was a cluster scene at best.  IMO, an independent film maker using REAL stop motion technique with a wide range of all the themes would do much better.  Finn's sister is old enough to play with normal legos after the 5 years, even before that though.  She wants Finn to play with her, but does she not have her own friends or her own batman.  I wouldn't want my lego minifigs covered in glitter and dancing to some teeny bop music.  Disappointed at the overfocus of the batman and Queen.

2019-05-19T02:13:38,"So I finished watching this, and I'm gonna have to get into spoilers. There was a lot to unpack here, and I actually realize that I don't like all of this lampshading of tropes and overly confusing character dilemmas. It's really hard for me to put into words, but I think there wasn't enough sincerity in this movie as there was in the first, and I'm just left with this discomfort that should've been better handled through...something in the movie. Pacing, character motivations, writing, I don't know. Mainly, I fundamentally don't like the rather twisted around message of ""everything's not awesome"" or ""not all of the time"", because I think I've seen enough of things generally in life not always being awesome. I do want everything to be awesome, I don't want to be thrown this far for a loop with the Queen and Rex especially, I DESPISE the disrespect they gave to Back to the Future because that's  loved by everyone and these things don't become loved by everyone for decades just to have someone else write this garbage villain who tries to sully something nostalgic for unexplained garbage reasons! Twisted seems to be a word that keeps coming to mind, and all I can think of this movie is that it's a twisted up version of what was already fine and cohesive and understandable. Who did all of this twisting? Why did they ever think they needed to? It was too much, and I won't look back on this fondly. I won't get along with anyone who subscribes to the ideas and ""mottos"" of this bad sequel. It doesn't matter to me what anyone thinks of my post here, or how it's read. It'll probably be a fairly incorrect way that I wasn't trying to convey. What I am trying to convey is that everything can be awesome, happy cheerful glittery colorful things should never be painted as weird or bad without gritty apocalypse garbage that I never liked also being painted as equally weird and bad, stop acting like we're somehow above predictable storylines because we can follow them so much better than rug pull after rug pull after mind cracking rug pull because in the pursuit of being so impressive and ahead of the curve I think they're getting unhealthy, and never play with the viewer's heart and mind like this because all I want is to have fun and this was not fun.

All houses are great and it’s great being in any. Being a Hufflepuff is not a bad thing because the. That means you are a nice, loyal, hardworking person who values fairness. Which are all good traits. In the clips I saw someone called Emmet a Hufflepuff which I can see him either being a Hufflepuff or a Gryffindor. I do think Gryffindor makes a bit more sense for him but he still has a lot of Hufflepuff in him. One character that is a Hufflepuff is Unikitty she is actually a Hufflepuff and I say that in a good way.
