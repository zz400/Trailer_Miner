I'm not going to go see it I'm never going to watch it even when it comes to Amazon or Netflix because I feel stabbed in the back because the movie companies make this movie basically right around the same time they made the first movie and they wait until now to release it I'm not into zombies anymore. zombies can go fluck themselves along with the  movie companies I'm sorry they just waited too long to bring this movie out when they already had it made you can tell that it was made right around the same time as the first one because the characters in the movie in the clips of this  second movie don't appear to be much older than what they were in the first movie you may be able to do with laughing with makeup but you can't makeup obrador telltale signs of real aging so for you out there that say they just   put makeup on, sorry but no they didn't because you can only cover so much  & none of them look much older than what they were in the first movie and you can tell that just by looking at them' they should have released this movie  sooner because  people like me and me myself are not going to go watch it, there was like fifteen thousand of us worldwide part of a club that we called the  Resident Evil Society it was a bunch of us who were really big into zombies and the Resident Evil games but not the movies because the Resident Evil movies suck. Anyway there is only about three maybe four people left in the club that hasn't disported and left the club so the Resident Evil Society Club is basically dead now and like I said when I was a member paying dues and stuff there was like fifteen thousand of us worldwide part of the club but the club zombie Society is basically dead now just like Resident Evil...",0,0,Conde Rodriguez,DjelrTXP21I,-0.10145929339477726,2019-08-20 01:16:44,True,True
