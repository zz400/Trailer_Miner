2017-12-12T13:46:31,"This looks pretty fun, ngl. But! I have a legit question, I'm still, (almost three movies later) struggling to understand why the antagonist is super evil? In the movies, she's bad because some immunes have died whilst she's struggling to find a permanent cure - which will cure all of humanity that is currently infected, (although how it'll magically heal half dead/rotting humans is a bit confusing but ok)... Which, whilst the loss of immunes is sad and all, I dont get why that makes her and the company super duper evil? It also doesn't make too much sense for her to be killing off immunes through too harsh/rushing testing cos there's a limited amount of them, which creates a problem qua finding a cure anyways so... Iuno, I just feel like it's very poorly explained/shown in the movies. You get given more of a ""We're telling you she's super duper bad, just trust us aight?"". So as these are based on the books, could anyone who's read them mebbe help me understand? Also, would you recommend the books? :)  Cheers!  x",0,0,Rose L,leFSYkUAaAw,-0.048004535147392294,2017-12-12 13:46:31,True,True
