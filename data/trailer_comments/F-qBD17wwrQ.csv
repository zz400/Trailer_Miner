The more money you contribute, the higher up the ladder you go. Their are many people that donate 100K or more which is only pocket change to the $'s Cruise and Travolta donate. When you discover the real truth of what goes on within the Cult, I'm sure you wouldn't donate as much as 1 penny.

2015-07-28T07:14:49,"So I'm curious, what is the thing at the beginning? I figure in real life it's just one of those giant plugs for a lake that let them control the water levels, but in the movie it's clearly something crazy.  Oh and no metal doesn't really mean no oxygen tanks, considering its Mission Impossible and the fact that you could use a mix of layers of plastic for the tanks then wrap that in carbon fiber. They actually use this method of wrapping tanks in super heavy duty carbon fiber on the space shuttles hydrogen tanks that are inside the fuel tanks. Those tanks use metal for the base layer, but without the carbon fiber they would never be able to hold the kinds of pressure. But you could make a scuba tank with no metal that would at least provide 10-20 minutes of air if not more, all thanks to plastic.  But I'll let that one slide because the movie looks really good, and I know a lot of people don't like Cruise because well, idk Scientology? but I feel he's been doing pretty solid work for a long time now. Then again I thought the Last Samurai and War of the Worlds were both incredible, and a lot of people thought they sucked because of him. If I have to choose between Tom Cruise and Keane Reaves from the Matrix you have to pick Cruise, he can actually do more than make one face and talk in monotone. I think the best part of this trailer is just simply the lack of major CGI, of course they still have CGI in there, but it doesn't stick out and look like CGI the second you see it, like in many action movies.",0,1,Jesse Lacey,F-qBD17wwrQ,0.07380952380952381,2015-07-28 07:14:49,False,True

2015-08-24T17:28:09,Today was another school holidays trip to the IMAX and i have to say i wasn't expecting too much but i think i came away enjoying this more than the kids ! Number five in the Mission Impossible franchise plays out much more like Bond film . The plot involves espionage with the CIA and the British secret service and the predictable bad guy/woman rogue agents and although it's quite a convoluted plot it never got too difficult to understand. The action is superb especially an amazing bike chase that takes you're breath away. I found this thoroughly enjoyable and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon with the kids.  8 out of 10,0,0,redvalleyjohn,F-qBD17wwrQ,0.18388888888888888,2015-08-24 17:28:09,False,True

2015-11-16T20:11:09,"Absolutely spectacular and riveting action espionage thriller with excellent cast, wonderful and mindblowing action sequences, it is funny at times plus it is a FIFTH FILM in the franchise and it just keeps getting better. Tom Cruise is insane as Hunt, he does some breath taking stunts , he is likeable and pushed to the limit. It is an amazingly directed and photographed movie tributing and referencing old tv show. Syndicate leader was an ok villain, you have seen this kind of guy before, but he was functional as an antagonist. Female sidekick kicked ass and Simon Pegg combined with Rhames and Renner were solid as supporting cast. It is a perfect blend of action and cool spy stuff although the story gets ridiculous and absurd plus Tom Cruise is more endurable than the Terminator. 4/5",1,0,ogorjefan,F-qBD17wwrQ,0.2825757575757576,2015-11-16 20:11:09,False,False
