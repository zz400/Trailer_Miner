2019-11-26T18:01:42,"I think we all know that is not the ""most entertaining film of the year.""  Lol.  They might just as well said ""it's a blast.""  The critical and audience feedback channels are completely corrupted at this point. You can't tell whether a movie is really good or bad until after it's been out for a week.  The studios and the Distributors taking over these feedback channels has caused me to stop being first week customer of any film.  Rotten Tomatoes is completely corrupted. Their feedback her movies only includes people who bought a ticket to the movie. This Means the audience rating is actually a rating of how good the movie is among people who already liked the movie.    This would be like saying how popular a brand of sauerkraut was among people who like sauerkraut. It doesn't tell you how popular sauerkraut is with the general public. And the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for movies no longer is useful for gauging how popular the movie is with the general public. It also has the side effect of making the audience pole have a smaller population which makes it super easy for the studios to buy a couple thousand tickets through a service and then spam the audience rating with a bunch of five star no text reviews. Or in some cases, ludicrously, five-star word for word identical reviews back to back for a couple of pages by ""different"" users.  If you wait until the second week, then you'll have a more truthful feedback on the movie and the extra benefit that more of your box office dollars will stay with your local movie theater and in your local economy.

The actors / actresses are great almost without exception and you have to consider that Christopher Plummer must have been close to 90 years old when the movie was made. He is still one helluva actor - one of my real favourites. The movie gets a bit predictable at certain points, but also takes som nice twists and turns along the way and I just cannot help falling in love with one of the main characters, Marta, played by the adorable Ana de Armas. I don´t want to spoil anything - so here´s a spoiler alert.........................................................but the scene almost at the end of the movie with the knife, had me almost falling off the chair. PS: I´m glad that I am not throwing up every time I lie........that would have been a terrible life for me so far 😄😆🤣😲🤪 PPS: Even this is a comedy - and how tragically it might also sound - but there are *MANY MORE* people than you would *ever* imagine, who turn into monsters in the process of inheritance.
