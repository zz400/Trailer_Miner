2016-12-14T16:37:29,"I really like how IE's films are so highlighted after Secret Life of Pets. Makes me wonder if they did a fantasy-based movie? Like mine - *The Voyage: Rise of a Hero* The story is all about Ragnar, a cowardly 13 year old orphan raised by the creatures of the wild as an infant looking for his purpose in life rather than stealing food to survive with Scarf, his pet ferret and best friend. He tends suffer from self-confident issues, has a ravenous appetite and is secretly the childhood friend of Princess Katie, the _only_ human who likes him. He's also a fan of the kingdom's greatest heroes called the Crowned Casters (Daroach, Vivian, Twilas, Gregorai and Rockwell) and is always dreaming of being a member of them. His dream now comes true when a tournament is being held and he gets chosen by King Abraham as the (accidental) champion who joins the heroes on the voyage to slay Zayvrok, a villainous gargoyle and the ruler of the Underworld, who wants revenge on Daroach for slicing off his wings and disgracing him. After a feast in his honour, Ragnar is overjoyed that he finally got the chance to become one of the Casters. Meanwhile in the Underworld, Zayvrok and his unholy army (of shoulder-high spear-wielding goblins made of shrubs, corroding zombies knights, slobbering dog beasts, huge leaches with vampire-like tusks, velociraptors with scorpion tails, ghoulish looking bats that serve as the mounts and a wise-cracking anthropomorphic mantis named Menty who serves as Zayvrok's number 2) must find the blood of the ""Halfborn"", a being who's born by both human and demon, to revive his wings before getting his revenge on Daroach, rule the Kingdom and later the world. During the journey and encountering some challenging obstacles along the way, Daroach becomes more closer to Ragnar like he was his own son and discovers that HE'S the being Zayvrok is after; There was a horn under his helmet, hidden underneath his wild red hair. The demons capture Scarf, prompting Ragnar to go after them, unaware he's being led into the Underworld and Zayvrok's plan now unfolds as his wings grow back and his army (who absolutely DESPISE humans) march towards the Kingdom. Unable to cope with Zayvrok's uprising and his dream crushed after Daroach revealed he KNEW he was the Halfborn the whole time, Ragnar sinks into manic depression before exiling himself away from the Casters and unknowingly comes across his former homeland, which is now a wasteland after Zayvrok's genocide. Scarf and Daroach find him and convince him to return to the Kingdom and save everyone, but not before remembering how his parents died saving him when Zayvrok first attacked with the help of a Recovery Orb. It was a tough battle, but they manage to vanquish the gargoyle and Ragnar is finally recognized as a hero and one of the Casters (only suffering a scar on his right arm after Zayvrok bit him when completely drunk/snookered with power). He even gets his first (accidental) kiss with Princess Katie.  THE END P.S, this is how Zayvrok is defeated: Ragnar launches himself from a catapult (a gag that happened earlier) towards Zayvrok while Daroach focuses on the second one and hurls Scarf at it. Everything goes slow motion from Scarf, Zayvrok laughing demoniacally, Ragnar kicking him in the face (while knocking out a tusk!), dodging his scythe-like right arm and slicing his wings off, Zayvrok falling from the sky as he see Scarf activating the second catapult which fires a boulder aimed at Zayvrok, who is sent flying from the impact. The heroes then fire a combined spell at him, doubled by Ragnar throwing his sword that plunges _straight_ through his heart, before dying with an explosion. Witnessing their fallen master, all the monsters retreat back into the darkness from whence they came. Ragnar survives by mastering his first spell, Beauteous Wings. So, what do you's think? Good? I even thought of the cast in case you's REALLY love it!: *Antony Del Rio as Ragnar* *Christopher Knights as Scarf* *DAN GREEN as Daroach* *Bella Thorne as Princess Katie* *Seth Rogen as Gregorai* *Michaela Dietz as Twilas* *Maya Rudolph as Vivian* *Mark Hamill as Rockwell* *Liam Neeson as Zayvrok* *Gilbert Gottfried as Menty*",1,0,Martyn McMurray,Rlq39IC07qA,0.11908068783068786,2016-12-14 16:37:29,True,True
