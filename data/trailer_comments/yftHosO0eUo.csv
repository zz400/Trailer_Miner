It is a tectonic boundary of the Pacific Plate and the North American plate, that boundary is called the San Andreas fault. Rockstar (the developers of GTA) chose the name San Andreas from the fault to be a state based of California. They didn't just make it up. As you may know, in the GTA world, Los Santos is based off and is the equivalent to Los Angeles. Where did they get the name ""Los Santos"" you wonder? Well, in Spanish ""Los Angeles"" means ""The Angels"" in English. LA's motto is ""The City of Angels"". So then Rockstar wanted to get something similar to ""Angels"", and they came up with ""Saints"". So ""The Saints"" in Spanish translates to.... You've guessed it, Los Santos, and the motto to Los Santos is ""The City of Saints"". So Rockstar have origin with their names, they don't just make it up like said before.

So rockstar didnt make thies up the names are reworded n used diffrently like the fault line its real they use sanandreas as a the title for the game. And places. They used might look like its from the game but originally the games graphics.n appearances are from real photos they just cut out diffrent scenic pics.

The movie looks like its going to take itself seriously. I think that The Rock is going to be a bad ass in this role. He's a pretty good actor when it comes to action movies and Hes been in a lot of good ones lately. I'm also really glad that Daddarios in this too. Shes one of those celebs who are very talented and have so much potential to be in great movies but for some dumb ass reason they end up in shitty ones(Percy Jackson, chainsaw massacre,etc). This could be the movie that makes her even more famous so she could play bigger roles in even more blockbusters. That way, the world could see more of her giant ti- er i mean, acting range lol. The.The special effects look pretty good. You can tell its CGI because our eyes are trained that way now, but the damage of the city and the collapsing buildings look solid. I know, its probably going to be a big,dumb action movie, but honestly thats all I want from this. Not a melodramatic, dull movie with barely annything happening(cough,cough, Day after Tomorrow.)   So basically, I'm looking forward to this movie.

2015-01-03T05:51:41,"Science time! The events portrayed of the San Andreas fault display the land splitting apart, creating channels, or sinking down. The sinking of land occurs in in Normal and Reverse faults, which creates the sinking of one plane if it is the Hanging wall or Foot wall, respectively, or from the creation of a fault basin where a shallow is created from the widening of a gap in the configuration of the fault line. But an even plane that is spreading apart, like the channel that you see The Rock drive up to, doesn't appear to be the work of faulting but of the creation of a Back-arc basin, which occurs when two tectonic plates are colliding and one plate sinks below the other, which is called subduction. The subducted plate melts as it enters the mantle and rises to the surface again, as it is less dense than the mantle's composition, the pressure forces the land to split to make room for the new melt to reach the surface. This can occur up to hundreds of kilometres away from where the plates collide.   Unfortunately, the region of California is not a subduction zone ( the entire west coast used to be, as it created the Rocky Mountains), it is instead a passive margin for the most part, as the plates are not colliding. They are instead grinding, as the whole San Andreas fault complex is a transverse or strike-slip fault, where the two sides grind along one another like two strips of coarse sand paper traveling in opposite, parallel directions. To take the analogy further, if you imagine a grain on either strip coming into contact, they collide head-on, so in very small and localized areas you will see Normal or Reverse faulting. But on a whole, the grinding of the strike-slip is what creates the earthquakes in the region.   So a correct depiction of the fault, lets take it a extreme for drama, that would create extreme destruction would be one side travelling 100m north and the other traveling 100m south, with land in close proximity to the main fault cracking, sinking or rising almost sporadically but certainly violently. As well as prolonged and intense earthquakes at least touching 8 on a Richter scale.",0,0,Numb,yftHosO0eUo,-0.045625901875901875,2015-01-03 05:51:41,True,True

The planet is in harmony with itself. If you pull a string, it will pull it back. Humans have been pulling too much. What will happen?

With about 300 large fault lines running beneath it, California is one of the most seismically active parts of the world, and has 37,000 tremors a year. Most are too small to be felt, but seismologists believe a couple of fault lines in particular — including the much-dreaded San Andreas — could trigger a megaquake similar to the one that flattened San Francisco in 1906, wiping out entire neighborhoods in seconds. Today, geologists say, there's a 99.7 percent chance of a Big One of at least magnitude 6.7 striking California within the next three decades, with Southern California most at risk. Fears that a big quake is imminent in Los Angeles were stoked in March when two earthquakes, including a magnitude-5.1 quake in La Habra, cracked walls, triggered landslides, and sent furniture flying. ""Sooner or later there's going to be the Big One,"" says U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seismologist Kate Hutton.  How bad would it be? ""You would see buildings collapse, you'd see people trapped, you'd see roadways collapse,"" said Kelly Huston of California's Office of Emergency Services. ""You'd see widespread destruction."" Under the USGS's crisis scenario for a magnitude-7.8 temblor in Southern California, the soil-filled Los Angeles Basin would turn into a violently trembling Jell-O, causing major highways and airport runways to buckle, water and sewer pipes to crack, electrical and gas lines to sever, and thousands of fires to break out across the region. Those blazes could then be whipped into a frenzy by the Santa Ana winds. Fiber-optic cables running across the San Andreas would be torn apart, and infrastructure would take months, if not years, to repair. The hospitals would be swamped by 50,000 injured people, and at least 1,800 would die.  Are these predictions reliable? Scientists consider the Big One inevitable, though they still cannot predict exactly where or when it will occur. Seismologists have only really just begun to understand the complexity of the 60 fault lines running below Los Angeles alone, and often discover new faults only after a major earthquake has occurred — as with Northridge in 1994, when a magnitude-6.7 quake killed 60 people. But they have real reason to be concerned about the inactivity of the San Andreas fault, the boundary at which the Pacific and North American plates grind against one another. Earthquakes occur when pent-up stress between tectonic plates is released along a fracture in the earth, known as a fault. In the case of the San Andreas, the southern section of the fault hasn't had a large quake for more than a century. ""That means stress is building, building, building,"" said Rufus Catchings, a research geophysicist. ""It's overdue for a really big one.""  What about other fault lines? Though seismologists have long dreaded a San Andreas–based quake, experts now fear that a tremor on the Puente Hills fault line could cause as much — if not more — damage. Running from the suburbs of northern Orange County straight through the densest neighborhoods of the Los Angeles Basin, a 7.5 quake on the Puente Hills line would affect millions — including downtown L.A.'s 4 million residents alone — killing up to 18,000 people, causing $250 billion in damage, and leaving as many as 750,000 households homeless, according to the USGS. ""This is the fault that could eat L.A.,"" said USGS seismologist Sue Hough.    ",0,0,Jamie Xx,yftHosO0eUo,0.03134613613337018,2015-04-20 04:07:24,True,True

просто єє поглотить...  я Арах говорю так, ето физика восьмого класа школи... закон кулона.... гроза уходит туда... где болєє позитивний заряд.... тоєсть... зємля имеет позитивний заряд електрони уходят в нее... но што случится, єсли ми создадим над землей болєє позитивную область, в котору попадаєт гроза, там два варианта, єсли ета область станєт нєгативной, остатки електронов, уйдут в землю.... а вот єсли она останєтся болєє позитивной, што тогда... єстествено всє електрони грози, поглотятся... да там залетаєт куча електронов, под напряжениєм.... а соответственно єсли поглотятся електрони, тогда призойдет слєдущєє, будет виброс или тепловой енергии или електромагнитной енергии, скорєє всєго електромагнитной, котору ми поглощаєм, очень короткими, и толстими котушками, вокруг, приємника грози... по скоку по скоку... так будєт... меня очень интересуєт интересний вопрос енергия может исчезать, или нет.... думаю может... почему, представим сєбєє, я меж двух магнитов, поставил котушку... и начал по нєй пускать ел магн ток, магнити начали поглощать магн енергию из котушки или наоборот єє усиливать... значит енергия преобразуєтся... интєресна мисль... а вот єсли исчезнєт, возможно ето использовать и в обратну сторону...  вот как можно откачать електрони.... моя идея така... взять трансформатор... к одному краю, присоєдєняєм питаниє переменоє, к примєру 220вольт.... а вот на втором виходє, напряжениє может бить 24, 180, 1000вольт и так далєє, к етому виходу лепим диодний мост, и ємкость очень мощнуюю, чем више йомкость тем лутше, минус, присоєденяєм к зазємлению, и принудитєльно виталкиваєм електрони  к примеру с помощю напряжения 10 тисяч вольт..... при етом, у нас ета область стаєт болєє позитивной чем зємля... и зависимо от ємкости нашей области, будєт и количество електронов, которих в ней не хватаєт.... ну а также от напряжения, которим ми викачиваєм... от чего зависит ємкость.. єстєствєнно от площади.... чев больше площадь, с которой снимаєм... моє предложениє, к примену взять в качєстве ємкости накоплєния позитивного заряда, тонкиє провода, бєз изоляции0.1 мм толщини, или же толстиє провода диаметра 10см... очень много мєж собой переплєтєних....  толщина етой колони, сплєтєной из проводов, не менше 10 метров диаметром и длина не менше 10 метров.. ето минимум... вобще идея така намотать таких стержнєй, диамєтром 100-300метров, и длиной 100-300метров, ета ємкость, имєєт очень большу ємкость приєма елєктронов, ми их витягиваєм с помощю електроного насоса...   а вот присоєдєняєм к етой ємкости... с низу електронний насос... а в верхнєй ставим огромную шпилевую антену, котору накриваєм металичним коничним колпаком, растояниє мєж антеной и колпаком сантиметров 10, для того, штоб слабая електростатика не попадала в антену из колпака, тоєсть нє садилась область заряда...  изолируєм нашу ємкость штоб била не електропроводной, а вокруг емкости с позитивним зарядом, создаєм ємкость с нєгативним зарядом, она будет отталкивать грозу... но над ней находится позитивна антена... гроза будєхт бить токо в нее, в меня остаєтся один вопрос как переработать поглощону грозу... но поглотить можно... и до 200 милний за сєкунд... визивая постояниє статичниє розряди из атмосфери.....    а вот стержни тесла... ето канєшно нє тє стержни тесла, но идея така... прощитиваєм, или находим нужну нам длину волни, и ширину антени, вибираєм как 4-10% от длини волни, а длину, кратную длинє волни... єсли волни, 15метровиє, толщина антени 0.6-1.5 метра... а длина антени к примеру 120 метров.... такая антена... очень хорошо поглотит в себя ету волну.....  по поводу приємника, которий будет принимать ету волну сєчас опишу....  приємник идея така, котушка принимающого контура, имеет очень мало витков, по при етом, очень большую толщину провода.. к примеру, котушка, намотана 5 сантиметрового диаметра проводом, вокруг феромагнетика, к котушкє присоєдєнен конденсатор, прєвращающий в колєбатєл.ний контур.... почему так смотритє, єсли ємкости соєдєнять паралєльно, ємкость повишаєтся, а вот єсли индуктивности паралельно, индуктивность падаєт, тут в меня нєскоко вариантов, можно захерачить... около 10 тисяч котушок паралєльно, штоб понизить индуктивность, а для сєма енергии, на стержень прицепляєм котушки очень малого диаметра провода, но ужасно большого количества витков, к етой сємной котушкє, цепляєм диодний мост... ставим кондєнсатор, и забираєм с етой стуки енергию, через резистори, ето для того, штоб нє било скачков напряжения... типа ми сделали сопротивлениє, ток которий может отдать сємник менше, значит он нє будєт мгновенно розряжатся...    смисл к примеру 10 тисяч котушок паралєльно в систєм.... ми паралельним соєдинениєм наганяєм нє токо котушки а и ємкость.... снимаєм из индуктивностей часть енергии, прєобразуя в високиє вольти, тут даже идея єсть по лутше, чем пускать на випрямитель..... идея кака снимаєм к примеру котушками в одном мєстє, частота у всєх одинакова... и ми его передаєм на собирающий трансформатор... где преобразуєтся тисяча сигналов одниєй волни... в один мощний сигнал... а енергию, ета цацка, забираєт из нашей антени, и видаєт от 1 квт до 100квт... почему я так считаю... скажем так в меня бил експеремент... брал провод, 1мм толщини и длини 80метров, виход 1-3вата... правда нада... хитрить.... за потрєблєниє сигнала яйца оторвут компании... поетому чудим по другом.... бєрєм, как приємну антену и дєлаєм ее трубою, а внутри нее ставим очень тонку антену излучения... излучаєм сами ту волну.... котору нам нада... принимаєм своєй антеной, возникаєт резонанс нужной нам частоти волни, начинаєт ити поглощениє енергии, и антена начинаєт жрать всю окружающу ел магн енергию, отдавая єє колєбатєлтом и била идея стержнєй никола тесла... он брал антену, длиной 15 метров.... брал ящик из двумя феритовими стержнями, думаю один из них принимал сигнал, второй его передавал..... а за счет резонанса... напряжениє ростєт в колєбатєльном контурє... знач ток падаєт... и соответствено систєма питаєтся поглотить енергию, по скоку, ми даєм ограничену, систєма, тащит в сєбя, всє ел магнитниє волни, окружающей срєди....    щє єсть тупая метода, сдєлать аналог спутниковой тарєлки, токо нє спутникова тарелка а коєшто другоє... берем лист телала, и згибаєм в длиную, полутрубу, точнее круговой  рєдставим себе трубу диаметром... 200 метров, ми ее нигдє не возьмем, штоб меряя с центра етой труби... отмерить угол 60градусов и вирезать етот кусочек для антени... но ми можем так вигнуть етот лист... в центре такого круга, ставим проводник.... к примеру провод диаметра 1 метр.... длина нашой антени до 200 метров, она принимаєт ел магнитниє волни из солнца, или луни... или стратосфери, а версия по мелче, можно у РЕСа воровать електроенергию... зачем... воровать в реса енергию протягивая провод, направляєм антену на их линию електропередач, а установка смонтирована на машинє, забираєм електрику... и например прєобразуєм, можем использовать штоб заряжать акумулятори, или же к примеру... ставим таку антену на хорошем растоянии метров 200-300 от линии високовольтних передач реса... внутри здания, штоб єє нє видно било....... дальше на приємном контурє... получаєм ету енергию превращаєм, єсли ресу не подсказать нє догадаются гдє утєчка... они привикли провода искать в 50 метрах от линии передач... для замиливания глаз, зариваєм под линию передач провод, длиной 200метров, в изоляции, пусть думают што через него пиздили....    ладно а сечас вещи по серєзней Афаєр.... што такоє афаєр.... идея така ето тец, которая снимаєт с помощю термопар теплову енергию,  теория.... термопара може иметь толщину в 1мкм єсли сопротивлєниє будєт минимум...  тоєсть ми дєлаєм чип термопару, толщина чипа... 1-100мм, в такой толщинє, с помощю малих прослоєк диелектрика, меж термопарами, можно сделать множество паралельних виходов из термопари, а в полтора года, я думал што можно сдєлать термопар... из сверхтонких листов мєтала.... толщини 0.01мкм.... чередуя к примеру сверхтонкиє листи серебра и лития... и от каждого такого листа, сделать отвод проводов, и каждиє два в притул сплавлених листа, єсть термопара, никаких диелектриков, типа чередованиє.... срібло-літій-срібло-літій і так далєє, и от двуй самих ближних пластин, сдєлать отвод отоводов, а ети провода, прикрепить к низковольтном акумулятору, из двух рядом расположених металов по електропотенциалу, к примеру разность потенциалов 0.1 вольт, зарядит такиє акумулятори, а потом включить последовательно такиє акумулятори и использовать как ток и високоє напряжениє...   што нада сделать, штоб рєбенок использовал не 1-3 процента от возможностей кори головного мозга, а к примєжру 3-20% и даже больше.. ето знаю, так вот друзя мои я научу, как сделать так штоб ваши дєти могли использовать до 6-20% потенциала кори головного мозга... ктото скажет нафига, проблєма в том што ви уже сами ето делаєтє, нє зная етого, а я лиш обясню как ето дєлать правильно....  скажитє, много ли людєй купило компютери и разрєшаєт смотрєть детям телевизор, вот он корень зла... которий дєлаєт умнее, да да, ток плохо єсли етот корєнь зла, учит всякой плохой фигнє... смотритє, што нада делать.... научится кремзать ужасноинтєлєктуальниє мультики, но при етом интєрєсниє, и начиная из пеленок, первих днєй жизни, давать смотрєть ето, ибо процентов 10% людей первиє воспоминания у них из утроби матери начинаются, как мать груддю кормила и так далєє, ви думаєтє я не такой, уже в полтора года, когда ребенок начнет формироватся, он уже будєт нормально воспринимать информацию, даже високоинтєлєктуальную, и будєт питатся єє понять, етого нє стоит боятся, єсли ми хотим розвиватся, так нужно дєлать..   а штоб в дєтєй айкю росло нада учить одновременно всем наукам какиє єсть, а также одной отой наукє которая нравится рєбєнку, тоєсть рєбєнок должен изучить ази пари сотєн наук... а также одну науку углублєнно, тогда в него будєт айкю в 2-4 раза више, чем в того кто учил токо одну науку... советую ето США, опомнитєсь, инта ростєт от изученя многих наук, а нє одной в украинє, тоже самоє... тоєсть рєбенок должен прєдставлять, как воно работаєт во всєх науках, самих полєзних, тогда и будєт толк, смотритє, от чего зависит интєлєкт от количества знаний??? нет.... уви нєт, от етого он не зависит, точнее косвєнно он зависит, но прямолинейно, интєлєкт зависит, от способности думать, видумивать и придумивать, ибо интелект ето мишления, а вот просто заученая велика куча знаний ето ерудиция, без способности думать и видумивать, ето всего лиш, куча штампов, но видумующий человек, может крутить етими штампами, куда угодно и как угодно, а просто ерудит, ето ходячая енциклопєдия, но он нє будєт интелєктуалом....  когдато познакомился с дєвушкой, а она мне ти представляєш мой отєц, строит триколайдерний мультитроний фазогенератор... я єй што ето такоє... я в шокє, а она нє знаю... я говорю а што ти говориш термини которих даже нє догадуєшся... а она мнє, папа посовєтовал прочитать словарь терминов, и позапоминать названия, я єй здрасвуйте, нада хотяби своими словами уметь обяснять то о чем говориш, а то што ето виходит, термин сказала... а обяснить не можеш.... а она вответ, да я такая дура, што елє названия виучила... я постоянно как вспомню, ржу...  ладно вернемся к Афаєру.... єго смисл... вот прєдставим себе, ми сделали испаритель какого то газа как в холодильникє... и он охлаждаєт до -80 градусов... к примеру, впихаєм етот испаритєль... в ядроафаєра, а температуру, точнее испарений газ виводим на наружний забор, к примеру греем жидкость котора идет на обогрев чегото там.... когда ми греем жидкость ми сжимаєм газ... и возвращаєм зжижений газ в афаєр.... тоєсть ето принцип зацикливания забора тєпла из афаєра, ядро, находится в геометричном центрє афаєра, тоєсть, по центру стоит в нас труба... диаметра метров 4-5 к примеру длини 50 метров.... внутри нее стоит ядро диаметра 2-3 метра длини 10 метров, ядро полностю покрито термопарними чипами..... тоєть в трубє ядро з чипами, виходи виходят за прєдєл труби, на акумулятори...... труба в центре соєденена из так називаємим теплосємником из зємли... длина теплосємника 80-100метров, диаметр 50-600метров, ету хрень класно в мировом океане будет использовать.... ядро забираєт тепло и жидкость падаєт в низ по трубєє... при етом тепло из жидкости... идет через термопари образуєтся електрический ток.... етот ток идет на акумулятори... итак жидкость пошла в низ и попадаєт на внешний контур огромной площади... и начинаєт нагрєватся... подимаясь по внєшнєму контуру вверх, а потом вверху идет в центр, гдє снова охлаждаєтся.... идея состоит в том, што сверхтонка термопара имеет очень малоє сопротивлєниє, при низкой температурє....  и я би ету идею, рекомендовал как минимум попробовать тем кто на геотермальних источниках термопарами получаєт....   теория АЛХИМИЯ как получить из свинца золото.... на самом деле ето термоядерна физика.... прєдлагаю два варианта.... первий ядро атома как и всє в нашой всєленой имеет собствену резонансну частоту... теория такова, єсли смоч заставить колєбатся атом с некой резонансной частотой, на протяжении долгого времини, резонансной частотой ядра атома, то через некоторий промежуток времени колебаниє протонов в ядрє атомов, может вирости на стоко што протон оторвется от ядра, при етом видєлится атомная енергия... а атом превратится в хим елємент на порядок ниже... к примєру бил свинєц, стало золото... когда атом перешол в другой вид хим елемента, резонансная частота ядра атома изменилась и ядро золота не будет дальше роспадатся.... тоєсть варианти как можно попитатся визвать резонанс очень простиє, ел магнитниє излучения, електро ток и ел магн индукция... вобщем там мало вариантов, но можно попробувать... второй вариант так називаємая ядерная физика, точнее висшая ядерная физика античастиц... єсли добить, некотороє количество антипротонов то можно попитатся ими бомбардировать атоми свинца произойдет атомний розрад... теория така... берем атомарний свинец... заряжаєм его негативно, и просипаєт небольшими дозами в ядерний реактор, где происходит образованиє антипротонов, так как антипротон имеет отрицатєльний заряд, такой как у електрона, то єсли он окажется очень близко к негативно заряженом атому, он притянєтся к нему, но изза того што в него очень большая маса... он не займет место електрона, а ударится в ядро... што привєдєт к тому, што в ядрє исчезнет один протон... и ядро перейдет на порядок ниже с видєлєниєм ядерной енергии... бил свинец... а стало золото.... люди сказали, што теоретично так и єсть, интєресно а на практикє так????    фаєтон... ето передєланий електродвигатєл... в меня хватило наглости прєдположить, што можно в место статорих обмоток в трефазного двигатєля... поставить якоря, коториє синхроно вращаются от разних приводов, но можно и от одного привода.... типа так  стоит в нас якорь привода... зубчатоє колесо закреплєноє на нем... к примеру на 5 тисяч зубєв.... к утому колесу через шестеренки к примеру по 25 зубєв в кажой шестеренкє, присоєденяются одноврємєнно всє якоря статора.... тоєсть за счет того што там диаметри шестеренок одинаковиє, и количество зубєв одинаковоє, они будут вращатся синхронно... таким образом, в роторе не будєт електромагнитних котушок, но при етом будет вращающееся магнитноє полє статора... за счет вращения якорєй статора.... теоретичєски... єсли якорь центральний 300метров диаметром, а якоря статора... токо 1 метр диамєтром, может проявится так звана вечна енергия... также можно взять центр якорь два метра... а якоря статора 1-2 см диаметром думаю любитєли ето испитают бєз каких либо лабораторий.... в чем теория штоб крутнуть якоря статора... нада потратить на каждий якорь скоко то енергии.. допустим ФМ помножено на длину окружности якоря, берем диаметр берем 1 метр...и виходит длина окружности 3.14 метров а енергия потраченая равна... 3.14ФМ/кпд привода... ну куда тут без него... кпд привода вичисляєтся как КПД редуктора* кпд ел двиг привода= 0.7280.72=0.52 в итоге... тоєсть енергия потраченая равна...в итоге 6ФМ на один оборот.... к примеру таких якорєй в статорє... 500штук... в итогє енергия потраченая равна... 500*6ФМ=3000ФМ....    теперь считаєм прибиль... так как в нас 500 якорей каждий даєм ФМ.... тоєсть 500ФМ.... крутной момент измеряєтся как 500ФМ на косинус угла отклонения магн поля... косинус угла отклонения равен 0.5-0.8... тоєсть видаєт скоко то там на 1 метр... типа 250 фм....  но длина центрального ротора при диаметрє 300 метров   300*3.14=940метров... а соответствено теоретично может начать вращатся, да и теоретично должен начать вращатся питаясь догнать магнитноє полє... но за один оборот магнитного поля он пробєжит 940 метров... 940*250Фм=24000Фм виход на генераторє... допустим кпд генератора... 50% виход виходит 12 тисяч Фм... при затратах 3 тисячи Фм....  нє знаю, я би на местє кулибинов собрал ету хрєнь, штоб провєрить...    Украинская интернет спільнота, письменників фантастів,письменник фантаст, псевдонім «АРАХ» Наукофа фантастична казка для дітей, до 70 років, котрі живуть, до самої старості, в кожній людині…. Скажімо так, сказка, лише на 1% від можливої інтелектуальної потужності, якщо хтось, подума, що їм бемкнули на повну, хай так не дума, їх дуже сильно пожаліли… і створили в 1 тисячу раз слабшу казочку, ніж моглиб, якби захотіли… Нехто не схотів брати «гріх» на душу, бо від тої казочки б багато політиків, наклалиб на себе руки, а так просто, будуть охрєнєвать…. Ета сказочка… сравнима с очень легким поглаживаниєм, против шерсти, против той сказочки, котору могли запустить єще летом 2014года, там би многиє с роботи сами уволилися, осли ету версію создавал токо я, то та версія моих лиш 230 страниц, а всего там чучуть 35 тисяч страниц с того што мнє сказали… и осли кто скажет, што ктоб єє читал, повертє, книга зафигачена, пошти тисячой человєк, куда кручє, книги сдєланой одним чєловєком, там сборник сочинєний такого рода, што даже представить нє реально, корда я прочитав 100 страниц, написаних другими, я охуєвал, моя писанина, ето так басня о балдє, или штото в етом родє, ничего особого… в той же сказкє, люди прилагают, чертєжи, и техничниє характеристики, коториє удивили даже меня, осли вкинуть, повертє, всє нефтєгазовиє компании и прочиє, потєряют всє, с виходом сказки, просто договорилися, лутше моя слабєнькая, и всєм будєт хорошо… осли они почуют нєладноє, и єє вкинут… жопа енергетике в течении года…. Там к примеру чертєж термоядерного реактора, котрий позволяєт расщєплять, кислород, или графит, или желєзо, там вродє как чертєжи расщеплєния, и так даліє боліє 20 химичних елєментов, коториє, не способи к самостоятєльном ядєрном рас паду, они изготовлени на базє, термоядерного реактора, розданого украинским НАН физики 1986 году, иними словами, ядерного матричного реактора, вес реактора, 200 кг, видаєт до 200 мегават енергии в час, сам нє доганяю, што ето за хрєнь…. При етом бєз радиации.. просто должни понищать, скинут казку, будєт єщє хуже, для нєкоторих… они понимают, моя казка, детский лепет, без чертєжей, и розработок, лет 10-50 уйдет на розработку, и генератори дорогиє… а в той сказкє, уже розработаниє, кемто чертєжи, и провєрєниє, так што друзя из заговоров, давайте жить дружно,  моя сказка, вам погоду нє сиграєт, а вот політично, ето алис-моргалис- глаз-у-попє-моргатус… Афаєр и фаетон нє такиє дєшовиє, будут…. Один фаетон, штоб построить нада пара трилионов доларов, нє менше милиарда, а насчет афаєра, там от 20 милионов доларов, будєт стоить один екземпляр… ми прекрасно понимаєм, годовой бюджет Китая 1 трилион доларов у год, но даже єму, понадобится лет 5-10 штоб построить Фаетон… мощностю около 10 терават в час… и ето осли он єще будєт рабо тать…  а афаєр, дорогой и очєнь маломощний, ну до 100квт в час при стоимости апарата от 20млн доларов… в лутшем случає, ети види генераторов, за 10 лєт, займут 1% от мировой енергетики, а то и того менше… тєм боліє, осли государства, или олігархи, нє начну тих строить, обичниє люди, их нє смогу, сами построить, ни дєнєг, ни тєхники у них нет, а оборудованиє, долино бить чрезвичайно точним, штоб работало… 	Мнє сказали, скооперируйся с кємто, и сдєлайтє их, я представляю што ето, єго штоб начать випускать, нужни годи работи, тисяч учених, занимающихся етим…. Просто так начать єго випускать, нє вийдєт, ето нє автомобіль, што раз, склєпал и поє хал…. Там скоко електронники управлєния будет што капец…. Можно дєлать матєринскиє плати, управлєния афаєра, работающиє, по принципу мобилки, пополнил сет, афаєр запустится, когда включиш, нє пополнил, нє включиш… и с фаетоном, то же самоє…. К примєру штоб фаетон видал один киловат… нада через интернет єго проплатить… к примеру 10копеек за 1 квт… а видаєт, допустим, 1мегават, то єсть в час нада платить на спец оператора, 100грн…. А што прикольно… електронику для афаєра трудно…  для фаетона єще труднєє, в фаєтонє, до 1 тисячи усилите лей, и комп’ютер из сложнейшей програмой распрєдєлєния енергии и генєрации переменних сигналов, при етом на пару тисяч виходов для сигналов, там тянєт нє то што на трилиони, а на сотни трилионов доларов, стоимость создания…. У афаєра, нє реально дорогими будут термопари електронника и акумулятори…. Осли к примеру житєли києва, то вместє, они скинувшись смогу купить афаєр на 10 мегават нє більше…. Што о других городах говорить…  хотя єсть задняя мисль, о афаєрє и фаєтонє, што любитєли научаться собирать, их мини версти, фаетон, ето генератор, из инопланєтного корабля, потєрпєвшого крушениє в Ростовской области….

Описания деталей из «камасутри», и других источников порносмисла… а также фото, порнографічного характера…. Котороє лутше детям до 18 лет нє смотрєть… Очень інтересно буде, і смішно, якщо наша держава, почне її забороняти, як книгу із порнографічним змістом…. А тут 100пудов, а може й більше, що цю книгу, заборонять, а заборонений плід, сляткий сляткий…..

Не подобається, хай не читають….  Сказка придумана так, щоб складалося враження, що її складала бригада інопланетян…. А також бригада божевільних геніїїв, проте, це лише спеціально так зроблено, якби ви знали паничі, як люди плачуть їбучі, то ви б елегій не варили, і марно слів не говорили, що є, то є, ви водовари, проте такого не минеш…  сочиняли і ржали шо лошади пржевальского, уже все що з архівів кгб найшли, перекрутили як могли… шоб смішніше було… в том числі інформацію таємної служби КГБ, про те, що з НЛО можно спілкуватися азбукою морзе, поставивши прожектор… прожектором в ночі даємо сигнали в небо для НЛО, а НЛО у відповідь підлітають, і починають відповідати з допомогою азбуки морзе… це потрібно робити на повнолуння, при повній луні, як не дивно, НЛО досить погано видно в небі… і в випадку чого, людям можно сказать, що в них глюки від луни….

Зовсім того… Собака да ладно, тобі хіба для стриптизу місця жалко? Кішка хай і стриптиз буде, а що тут такого? Арах хто перший почина вигадувати? 	Кішка в деякому царстві восьмидесятому государстві.. треба що далі подумать… 	Мишка жив був гарі потер 	Дрізд а з ним жили ще, оніл, картер, та деніал джексон 	Півень і командував в них парадом агент 007, а його ад’ютантом був індіана джонс 	Собака і герміоні грейдер дуже подобалось танцювати стриптиз, перед гаріпотером… 	Арах у гаріпотера був ворог валдеморт, і в нашій фантазії, замість авадикедаври, в нього буде нова коронна фішка, стільба із пушки, що зжимае матерію, за рахунок того, що з неї зникають електрони… Поясню як це, справа в тому, що в ядерній фізиці, існує розділ вищої ядерної фізики, теорія матерії та антиматерії, так ось, волдеморт стріляє концентрованими, антиелектронами, і при взаємодії антиелектронів з електронами атомів, атоми зникають, нічому в атомах рухатися, і атоми зжимаються, наприклад, якщо атоми не рухаються, за рахунок електронів, в 1 см куб може поміститись 100 тон атомів… 	Собака, добре тоді в гаріпотера власна коронна фішка, замість експеліармуса, він стріляє із кулемета, кулями, в яких є важка вода та каталізатор, коли відбуваеться постріл, важка вода(ядерне паливо) змішуеться з каталізатором, відбувається ядерна реакція, і одна така куля здатна знищувати БТР, або навіть танк.. 	Арах тоді в герміони грейжер «меч осіріса» Поясню що це таке, осіріс «бог» древнього египту, насправді інопланетянин, мав енергетичну зброю, у вигляді меча, котра на кілька секунд, відкривала міфічний ефір, по іншому гіперпростір, і спрямовувала в певному напрямку енергію, що виходила із ефіру… 	Півень добре тоді агент 007 та індіана джонс озброєні гарматой, імя якій пушка променів смерті Нікола Тесла..    Поясню що це таке, ето оружие королівства «Кадагар», как оно работает, ето нановолновое оружие, но ето условоно нановолновое оружие, на самом деле, ето оружие, випускает, електромагнитние волни, на частоте 1 кгц, именно так, а вот так називаемая вторая частота, 100терагерц, тесть нижняя мощность волни к примеру 20 тл, а верхняя 100тл, а вот при воздействии на атоми тела человека, она проявляеет, действие нак нановолновая, об’ясню почему, на примере трехфазного асинхронного двигателя, експерементировали, с трефазником, на приколе… взяли создали генерацію фази, если в обичной фазе есть +220 и -220 вольт а также ноль вольт, в нашей фазе, сдвинутой в верх,  Тесть там где било -220, в нашей фазе било +120 вольт, там где в обичной фази 0 вольт в нас било +170 вольт, там где в обичной фази, +220 вольт в наше тоже било+220 вольт, частота 50 герц, и шо б ви думали? Асинхронний електродвигатель маслал 49 оборотов за секунду на холостом ходу, а ми ржали, што кони, знаете што ето означает, длинная волна, с переменной напряжонностю, магнітного поля по мощности, также способна визивать, колебание атомов как и при микроволнах, но в отличии от микроволн, распространяется, на сотни км, на основе етого принципа, в агента 007 и индиана джонса, електромагнитная гармата, променів смерті Нікола Тесла 	Кішка в рональда візлі, наприклад енергетична гармата Нікола Тесла, теорія направленого вибуху, наприклад направленого вибуху, атомні бомби. Як це працює. Наприклад в нас маеться вакуумна труба, довжиною 5 м діаметром 10см, внутри труби, близько 100 минизарядов, ядерного типа, маленьких, не обязательно ядерних, когда с одной сторони взриваем перший заряд, он взривается во все сторони, но при етом, он цепляет второй заряд, он тоже взривается во все сторони, при етом, оказивается, што в сторону, противоположную, пришедшей ударной волне, ударна волна, стала більше, такая фигулина, позволяеет, взривая обичну взривчатку, создавать взривну волну, у все сторони 20 м діаметром, но в сторону куда ми направили, 2км, тесть вистроение заряди в одну линию, если подривать крайний правий, на крайнім левом, сформируют направлений взрив, дального действия, в ядерной бомбе, во все сторони, дальность волни 5км, а в сторону направлености до 500км дальность удара взривной волни.. 	Дрізд В саманти картер, спеціальна зброя азотний хладомет, котрий в одну мить здатен в напрямку противника відправити азот 200грам, на відстань до 600м, за рахунок пострілу азотом, котрий, знаходиться снаряді.. тобто капсулі, котра при ударі об тіло розібеться, азот почне випаровуватись, і охолоджувати все, на що попаде рідкий азот. 	Собака в деніела джексона пси-радари спеціалізація Що таке пси-радар, нажаль це аж ніяк не собака радар, це психічний радар, котрий визначає, де знаходяться, живі істоти, котрі здатні думати, і про що думати. Як виникла така ідея було виявлено, що я здатен читати думки через телефон, після аналізу даних, зрозуміли, що я здатен сприймати, електромагнітні хвилі, без обладнання, коли я читаю думки, через телефон, це означає, людина, коли думає, випромінює думки, у вигляді електромагнітних хвиль, думки, дуже слабким сигналом, передаються, через сигнал телефону, і мозок сприйма сигнал.. відповідно, це можна зробити технічно, і навіть, зробити спеціальний радар, котрий здатен уловлювати сигнал, випромінюваний людьми, і на комп’ютері, розшифровуватись, пси-радар дозволя читати думки, бачити і чути, те, що чує людина, на котру налаштовано, пси-радар, це теж супер-зброя… 	Півень в оніла, є комп’ютер, котрий здатен зв’язуватися, зі супутником, після чого, супутник, активує пушку заряджених частиц, негативнозаряжених іонів, котрі спрямовуються в сторону землі. 	Мишка значить так із зброею, особливою головних героїв розібралися, перейдемо до історії     	Собака дело било в 1997 году, началась война меж інопланетянами и землянами.. 	Арах какой нафиг 1997, он уже прошол по времени, нифига там не било, пусть будет в 2020году, ето время еще не наступило, поетому всякое может бить.. 	Дрозд и напали на землю гуаулди из звезених ворот первого загона.. 	Арах им помагать подписался волдемарт 	Кошка в гарипотере его же убили уничтожив все восем осколков души волдеморта 	Арах а кто сказал што их не могло бить девять.. и люциус мелфой, спустя годи, возродил ево с мертвих… 	Дрозд, ти би еще и дамбулдора придумал как воскресить.. 	Арах а по чему би и нет, гари потер нашол четвертий дар смерти котрий позволяет когото, одного воскресить, во плоти, но он жив до тех. Пор, пока етот дар смерти у него, как токо, он теряєт дар смерти, он исчезает в небитиє, откуда и бил призван… иними словами етот амулет, всегда висит на шее у воскресшего дамбулдора.. 	Мишка а што вариант, подогнать би ету идею, Джоане  Роулинг… 	Півень ну а за землю как в звезених вратах азгарди вписались.. 	Собака довольно хихикая, промичала, ага а куда же без них 	Кошка штото малувато в нас героїв, давай но добавим кого нибуть, к примеру саурона, с властелина колец 	Дрозд не ну знач если есть саурон нужен и фродо и гендальф, гендальфа обгрейдим мечем ваальхали, аналогом меча осириса, принцип тотже, ток мечи разние	 	Півень а што би подогнать такое саурону, допустим у него  громовержець зевса, а у фродо трезуб посейдона… 	Кошка тут не хватало токо лиги справедливости.. бетмена, супермена, леди яструб и других 	Собака кажется ми занимаемся роздувательством етой истории	 	Арах ага дуєм мильний пузир, в надєжде, што он лопнет… Кошка и висадили гуаулди войска на землю 9мая 2020 года, хи хи.. Арах и обнаружил ето дениел джексон с помощю пси-радаров.. Мишка и началась война.. Дрозд не в жизнь а в смерть, ну чесно слово…	 Арах ну хватит воду лить, и не чево конкретного.. допустим от гуаулдов в сторону москви оправилась десятая осадная бригада.. Кошка а на пентагон напали трилобіти с цефалоподами Собака какие еще трилобіти и цефалоподи Кошка те котрих пентагон случайно с пришлого притянул, експерементируя со временем Арах ну ладно допустим, кто еще куда напал? Мишка неандертальци окупировали лондон.. Арах а они откуда там взялися Мишка ну англичане тоже доексперементировались со временем… Собака птеродактели напали на белий дом… Арах а там у белого дома тоже експеримент со  временем бил? Собака не с пентагона прилетіли… Кошка тирекси решили отдохнутиь и рослабится в лосанжелесе Арах а ани какого там делают? Кошка бежали от пентагона, сильно устали, решили передохнуть, в лосанжелесе, за одно  и м’ясом перекусить.. Дрозд гигантские мухи, размером сантиметров десять, напали на берлин Арах а они с какого измерения? Дрозд они жили на шоколадной фабрике, шоколад кушали, а потом случился виток какогото химиката, и они начали рости, как на дрожжах Арах ну а где же сопротивление етой всей нечисти… Собака росяне сбросили на гуаулдов ядерную бомбу Арах и как убили? Собака не даже не поцарапали, гуаулди ее телепортировали, прямо на ейфеливу башню… Арах и она естествено взорвалась?.. Кошка нет ее супермен впоймал, и в космос от правил.. Дрозд и тут на киев напали велики…. Арах велосипеди? Бунт машин? Дрозд нет велоцераптори, их гуаулди притащили, штоб отвлекали внимание… Кошка и тут Зелені Чоловічки на бтр з донецька на київ рушили, в них зявився шанс, до киева подехать, пока армія с великами розвлекается.. Собака украинская армія, решила научится їздить, на великах… прикрепив на них седло для лошадей…. Кошка и пока украинская армія осваивала, новий вид транспорта, другого вибора в них не било, очень плохое финансирование армии…  зеленим чоловічкам, з донбасу, заступив дорогу фродо торбінс, с трезубом посейдота, я повелитель семи морів, ану замітайтеся звідси, щоб я вас тут більше не бачив… і грізно потрусив трезубцем…. Собака, и тут к нему подходит гот.. слиш чувак, прикольний у тебя видон, и палка прикольная, а фродо ему в ответ, ти кого чуваком назвал, смерд поганий, ти кастрирований баран….     Не множмо передохнем, от фантазии, не множмо политики, все говорять украину нада списать. Я так вижу, еще чучуть, и ее начнут спасать, от нас самих.. Ответ на письмо с администрации президента, если ви считаете, што идеи украинцев нам нужни, ви глибоко, ошибаетесь, в нас таких как ви, фантазеров, полно, люди шлют нам письма, видать они все решили, што они какието особенние, ну зачем нам нужни ети идеи, идите и пашите, в бюджете денег нет… ну я как списатель… чучуть приукрасил, но суть ответа не менял…    Дрозд и посадил дед репку… Арах а репка тут к чему? Дрозди и начал ее поливать сельськохозяйственной химией, и виросла она большая пребольшая діаметром 10 метров, и дед начал звать супермена, штоб он помог ее витащить Собака ну и как помог ему супермен витащить, думаю он сказал ему, дед ти што больной, в твоїм коренеплоде, химии більше, чем питательних веществ.. сожги ее нафиг, будет гореть не хуже бензина, или тебе в етом помоч… Кошка жучка решила позвать внучку, штоб она позвала бабушку… Собака слишиш кошка, анука бистро закрой хлеборезку.. Кошка  все ти меня обидила, зачем било, мой миленький ротик, хлеборезкой називать.. Собака ти што, вобще дура? Мозги висохли? Ти последняя хлеб резала?.... Кошка да, я, а што… Собака ну так закрой же ти в конце концов, хлеборезку, пока туда мишка не попала, я понимаю, м'ясо мишки, для тебя делікатес… и ти решила хлеборезку, вместо мишоловки использовать???... Кошка в чем ти меня подозреваеш? В попитке убить мою подругу мишку? Арах так ви што, тут подратися решили? А кто будет сказку писать? Или што там у нас получается? Дрозд ладно заметано, все другани, не соромся, итак гари потер влюбился в таню гротер…    И тут автор призивает нового соавтора… президента украина Лева Лев так куда це я попав, мене що інопланетяни викрали? Кішка нас запитання Лев,а чи берете ви хабарі, бо в нас підозра, є така, як берете, ми скличем, наш казковий суд… з казок прийдуть туди присяжні… для казки, чесно вам скажу, вже не такі, ви й недосяжні, і мури ваші, не такі міцні… котрими ви, відгородились, да так, що аж ніяк не можно, до вас пробитись, і не мрій, а в мріях та казках, можливо все… Собака кішка діло каже, почнемо допит президента україни, коли у кого, скіки, хабарів взяли? Лев та що ви, та невже ви такої поганої думки про мене?... Дрозд не важливо якої ми думки, ану говорите место, скоко, где, когда, кто дал хабар, и изза чего, вобщем фото, видео, письменне заявление, явка с повинной… Лев слушайте, я ведь не Янукович, ето с ним розбирайтесь… Мишка походу Лев, хочет очну ставку с Януковичем… Арах я думаю йому не очну ставку з януковичем треба, а в уявному світі за стіл переговорів з Орлом посадити, отже словом автора, раз, два… три…. Президент Росії Орел в сказочний мир прийди Орел так я не понял, инопланетяне, или колдуни, меня с Кремля украли? Што вам от меня нужно, от вернуся в Кремль, дам приказ, проблеми будут… Арах уважаемие президенти Украини и Росии в етот трудний час, ми собрали здесь вас, штоб вислушать, почему ви не можете договорится о мире… и к примеру Орел, может ви отпустите Надежду Савченко? Орел так, а ти не оборзел, тварь.. Арах Орел в меня к вам просьба, если не ошибаюсь, не скажу раен, но укажу предварительное ростояние от москви, где ваши учение, питаються, не совсем безуспішно, отремонтировать НЛо из знаком триелектронний атом вроде… точно не знаю, в меня просто ктото с ваших спрашивал, не знаю ли я, как оно работает, но попросил ему розказати… Орел он совсем припух, такое спрашивать, ето же федеральний секрет росии Арах Нло дисковидной форми, цивилизации «кандагор» когда крутяться диски, между ними начинают пробиватся симпатичние синии іскорки, етот обект находится на ростоянии близько 180 км от Москви… ваши учение не совсем понимают, как он летаєт, вот на скоко я понимаю, етот диск, является, магнитом, движущим електрони, под. некоторим напряжение, и викачивающим, електрони, из нижній части НЛО в верхню… кстати Орел, ви ведь играете в шахмати, и в вашем кабинете должен бить ящичок, если не ошибаюся, с вашою любимою шахматной доскою, она в вас довольно давно.. Орел подозрительно, както откуда ви о ней узнали, я ведь етого не афиширую… Лев кажется ви меня заинтриговали, я уже перестал понимать, што либо.. походу, ви одного поля ягоди… Орел слушай Лев,… орел, червяку не товариш… я орел, а вот он, червь, непонятно откуда вилезший… Арах да хоть и бактерія, лиш би между Украиной и Росией, мир наступил, негоже братьям, друг друга убивать…     Собака слушайте, в меня идея, можно построить усовершенствование автобани, как ето, смотрите летом автобани перегріваються, зимой их заметает снігом, весною сніг починає розтавати, дорога почина руйнуватись. Тобто проблема номер один, це сніг, чому так, сніг випада на дорогу, взимку починаеться відлига, вода розтає, і проходить в пори асфальту, потім починається мороз, вода розширюється, асфальт починає руйнуватися. Кішка авжеж і тут є два варіанти, перший, щоб на дорогу не падав сніг, другий щоб дорога підігрівалась… Арах кицю ти права, але насправді, варто зробити і те і інше… бачили коли небуть теплицю? Перетворимо автобан, у суцільну двошарову теплицю… зовнішній шар теплиці затемнений, і влітку сонячне світло, майже не падає на автобан, а нагріває поверхню… взимку теплиця не дає падати снігу на дорогу, це зменшить аварійність на дорозі, додатково, чому, не випав на дорогу сніг, знач чистити не треба, а відповідно, при відлизі, він на дорозі, не буде розтавати, а значить.. він не перетвориться в ожеледицю, на дорозі.. Мишка В цієї теплиці створимо спеціальні вїзди в неї, котрі мають довжину до 200м, на вїзді поставимо купу радіаторних батарей, котрі запитані теплом грунту, як? Під землю загнано 20 метрів, теплознімаючий контур, на зовнішній поверхні, він перетворюється в батареї, дана конструкція, взимку, без електрики, з допомогою рідини з антифризом, здатна нагрівати повітря, до температури, не вище 8 градусів цельсія. При температурі,     «-15 град» на улиці, в автобані буде до «+4» град цельсія… Дрізд Як буде працювати, тепло нагрівач, всі чули про єстественну конвекцію, про те,  що при різних температурах, она й та сама рідина, має різну густину… отже при температурі, в +7 град цельсія вона має одну густину напр. 1.1грам на см куб, а при температурі -4град 1.13грам на см куб, різниця маси 1.13-1.1=0.03 грама на см куб, це говорить про те, що холодна рідина, буде опускатись в низ, витісняючи нагріту, тобто в нас на поверхні стоїть радіатор, в котрий зверху, заходить рідина температури +7 градусів цельсія, починаючи з глибини 2 м, і до входження в радіатор, вгорі, теплоізольована, щоб не було втрат тепла… Півень моя черга, а то я мовчу і мовчу.. з нижньої точки радіатора, іде добре теплоізольована труба з холодною рідиною, наприклад на глибину 20 метрів, котра на дні, заходить в теплозаборний контур із землі, діаметр труби, до 400мм, щоб не було виликого супротиву рідині… тобто система працює на тому що, природною конвекцією, кожен радіатор, переміщує, дуже велику кількість нагрітої землею, рідини в гору, вгорі вона охолоджується, і пада, по теплоізольованій трубі , в низ, витісняючи нагріту, змушуючи її циркулювати, в системі. В Росії, на дальному сході, деякі люди, обігрівають, підвали, таким методом, а інколи навіть і двори, але це не інформація, для вікіпедіїї, та нехай, йому… суть в тому, що так нагріти можна добре теплоізольоване приміщення, або двір, зроблений по типу теплиці, а щоб влітку не було жарко, вона не одношарова, а двошарова, внутрішній шар прозорий, зовнішній шар, темного кольору, він поглинає, 80-90% сонячного світла, тому двір цих росіян, як гігантська бесідка, літом прохолодно… а взимку близько+7 градусів цельсія, і виходить, що й будинок, фактично опалювати не треба, поряд зі двором, стоїть близько 100 світлових генератора, притянутих, з китаю, для забезпечення електрикою, мешканці дального сходу росіїї, кажуть про те, що через те, що в росіїї, не має газу для населення, їм приходиться обходитися світловими генераторами.. І вони б українцям, рекомендували, якщо в них є сіра рідина, в голові, поступати, як вони.. тобто, максимум тепло збереження, забір для обігріву, тепла землі, та альтернативні джерела енергії… чого вони там не наробили, собі в росії, і електромагнітні хвилі, переробляють, в електрику, і сонячне світло, і навіть тепло насосні тец, намагаються собі по робити, поки що їм вдається тец такого типу, тец потребляє для своєї роботи 1квт наприклад, а за рахунок цього виробляє 1.4 квт електрики, плюс нагрів… самому цікаво… на це подивитись…     Лев ну ти і фантазер, я в повному шоці, живи реальним, тобі шкідливо фантазувати.. Арах а ви живете реальним і ніколи не фантазуєте, при цьму обличча осяяла хитра усмішка… Лев я живу тільки реальним і не фантазую.. Мишка хи хи, хи хи, аж заливается.. Собака уши б мои етого не слишали… ох и смеется кошка, кажися, щас она штото вякнет.. Кошка да ладно господин президент, еслиби ви, не били фантазерем, ви би никогда не покидали психбольницу, хи хи хи, все все, щас продовжу, хихихи.. дело в том што способность мислить вообще, ето не реальность, а фантазія, да да , то што ви мислите, ето не происходит в реальности, ето происходит в голове, и еслиб ви, не умели мислить, а соответственно и фантазировать, ви би не били президентом, а билиби гдето на дурке, где вас питалися, би научить думать, а соответственно фантазировать… Арах ви говорите што ви реаліст значит, вас стоит назвать фантазер-реалист, ну а я фантаст значит фантазер-фантаст, но на самом деле ми оба фантазери, ви фантазируете о реальном, а я о неком фантастическом, или ви не согласни? Лев походу ви меня загрузили, щас чайник закипит.. Арах што ми все о грусном, да о грусном, давайте кА пригласим комиков, из росмеши комиков, и попробуєм розсмішить… Орел ето тех. Троих лисого, похожого на цикало, и того што за пультом постоянно смеется..?    Арах так зверям молчать, штоб комиков не напугали, и так начнем шури мири, абари картири, гаузи мікаузи клоуни из розсміши коміка прибивайте…  тот што за пультом, соний появился.. не понимая где он… за ним похожий на цикало… а потом лисий в одном полотенце, походу с бани токо виходил… Лисий так штото тут не так, пора назад в душ ноги делать, токо купатся собрался.. Лев твоє счастьє, што не начал купатся… Орел мне кажется у лисого, лисина, на колобка чемно похожа… Лисий да ви што издеваетесь, лутше би халат дали… Кнопкодав не сов сем понял как, и почему ми здесь… Арах вас попросили появится здесь, штоб било весело.. Цикало штото в нас никто не спрашивал, хотим ли ми сюда… Арах а давайте ми вас попробуєм росмешить, думаєте не вийдепт? Лисий блин какиє извращенци, обачно к нам приходять штоб нас росмешить, а тут нас притянули, штоб нас росмешить, ладно смішите, и домой отправляйте Арах итак украинский хор песни и пляски, «звери» Цикало в смисле Сергей Зверев и его друзья? Мишка в смисле поют звери… ойой, походу кнопкодав в обмороке… да и лисому поплохело… а вам цикало, как я смотрю вас росмешили? Сечас от смеха под. стол залезете… Цикало чесно, никогда не думал, што лисого и кнопкодава потушит белочка…. Мишка видать и вас вставило… што ви севодня курили? Цикало не не курил, походу консерви спорчение попалися, што уже глючит, што я кудато попал, и с белочкой розговариваю… Собака ето не белочка, а миша… Цикало ну точно консерви палениє с наркотой…. Если собака заговорила, наверно петух, кошка и попугай щас заговорять, не удивлюся… Дрозд обижаете господин, ви дрозда от попугая, отличить не можете… Лисий я уже минуту за вами наблюдаю, ктонибуть, наберите телефон скорой, пора в больницу єхать, ато с головой штото не так…. Кнопкодав а по моему здесь даже прикольно, звери говорять, и президенти двух стран, тут токо Барака Обами не хватает, а хотілось би ево увидеть… Арах во имя сказки, пусть исполнится твое желание Обома, вот, што ето еще такое, люди в черном, наверно на роботе позасипали, раз не контролируют інопланетян, што они уже и президентов начали похищать…   Кошка а давайте в натуре визовем інопланетян… Собака перший вводний знак СССР триелектронний атом… Петух второй вводний знак СССР два схрещених меж собой треугольника Мишка третий вводний знак СССР звезда Дрозд четвертий вводний знак СССР серп и молот .. Кошка требование нимизид, штоб все люди стран имели доступ к максимуму засекреченой информации в течении 10-25 лет после засекречивания, за исключением особо важних секретов.. Мишка люди должни знать где, какое НЛО летіло, или упало, на даний момен етим требованиям, соответствуєт, болем мение токо Росия, может ктото подсказал, а может и сами догадались, ибо токо так, можно начать общатся с иними цивилизациями…    Петух взиваю к богам древнего египта, древній греции, а также скандинавии, ваше оружиє, имело источником темновато красную енергію, из подпространства, которая попадаєт, в подпространство, из звезд и солнц, етот процесс происходит за счет того, што внутри Звезд, очень большая енергія, частота електромагнітних волн, очень сильно увеличивается, ето откривает, для енергетических волн, «врата» в подпространство… енергія уходит в нево, а ваше оружие, откривает ети врата, и енергію, виходящую с них, направляеет в определеном направлении. Науки, о вашем оружии, на етой планете нет, ви знаете што ето значит… Дрозд просьба к Росии, ви уже привикли, што с вас сміються, што ви верите в НЛО, сделайте следущий шаг, официально обявите, што ви создаєте перший в мире космодром, для НЛО, даєте им какиєто права при прелете, гарантируєте, безопасную посадку, передача сигнала, предложения НЛО официально прилететь, должна бить в универсальной форме, тесть, составлена так штоб не токо на украинском, росийском и так далее, язиках, а также на так називаемом язике образов, тесть к примеру видео или фото, а потом, название буквенно, и как звучит. У вас есть шанс, стать первими, хто начнет официиально торговать с нло,  Кошка што могут покупать инопланетяне, перечень, што можно предложить не большой, продукти питания, туризм, развлечения, предмети культури, сувеніри, и так далее.. Арах суть в том, што ми подразумеваем, што в инопланетной цивилизации, которая прилетит, техничний уровень розвития, куда више, чем у нашой планети, и наши деньги, по сути им не нужни, как и наука и техника, но если они начнут куплять, продукти и прочее… они свои деньги, начнут менять, на месние, а вот за ихниє деньги, в них, можно купить, штото с науки, техники и оружия(спорний вопрос, врядли продадуть). Вобщем в Росии есть шанс, стать первой страной, начавшей торговать с НЛО…     Дрозд рекомендую всем странам начать генетические иследования, ето позволит обнаруживать екстрасенсов еще на стадии рождения, и даже, создания яйцеклетки, одним словом, когда будет оплодотворена яйцеклетка, уже будет извесно, может иметь екстрасенсорниє способности или нет… Мишка дети, з екстрасенсорними способностями, возрастом до одного года, рекомендується обучать с помощю високоінтелектуальних фильмов, и мультфильмов, ето даст в итоге, супер мутер екстрасенсов, да еще и изобретателей, етот принцип позволяєт, создавать целую армию, подобних Николе Тесле, к примеру, пару милионов таких людей в год… ето круто, и ето возможно.. генетика+ обучение… думаю боле крутой гадости человечество, не в силах будет видумать…. Перед етим, тухне, любая атомная бомба… ибо ето позволяет создавать учених, способних, звеличить темп, развития науки до 100раз… и даже более… Петух в чем же дело? Дело в том, што ми нашли таких, детей, даем им толчек мультиками, фантазировать, они начинают, сразу же, штото свое видумивать, и пользоватся екстрасенсорними способностями, человек, из екстрасенсорними спосібностями, способен легко придумивать, то чего еще нет в науке, никто об етом не слишал, и даже предположить об етом не мог… тесть екстрасенс, и которие на много сильне обичних учених могут видумивать…. За счет того, што они с очень ранего возраста ето делают. Такие дети способни, всякую техничную гадость видумивать, ядерние бомби, нло, самолети, електромобили, танки, вечние двигатели, и всякую всякую лобуду,. Вот такиє крендели, з сахаром и пудрой…. К примеру США или штото по менше… например цунами висотой в 20 км, никто не проверял, ето би смело парочку островов как минимум… или к примеру, атомну бомбу, антиматерии не провіряли, просто по физике сделали расчет… 1 кг антиматерии равно 20 кг урана… а вот из паралельними мирами били експерименти, не ясно на скоко удачние, но роботи, котрих отправляли, исчезли бесследно, значит кудато улетіли… даних по експериментам не знаю, скажу одно, откривают високочастотние електромагнитние волни…. Один из роботов вернулся, он добросовісно часа три, снимал, што ми делали, хотя ми его чем токо не искали, так и не нашли, пока он сам не появился, думаю такое случилось и с Елдриджом в експериментах США, на каких частотах исчез, не в курсе, сканировали, генерировали точнее начиная с 0.00…гц и в сторону повишения частоти…     Вот например, создать технологический центр, в котрий все люди подряд, сносят фантазии и идеи, а они там обрабативаются, проеряются, и создаются новиє технологи.  Кошка Или можно перестроить государство, в производителя заводов и фабрик, которие покупают люди, в безпроцентний кредит, в итоге они возвращают кредит, и платят налоги, которие являються процентами по кредиту… при етом, постояно растет ввп от 10 до 70% в год… если учесть, што кредити постоянко возвращаются видающей в кредит заводи, установе, в нее накапливается етот ресурс, возвращенний назад, и она може тих снова видавати, плюс єжегодно от 10 до 90% от бюджета страни, идет в ету установу, которая производит мастерскиє, заводи, фабрики, продаєт в кредит тут и в правду намечаєтся рост ввп от 10-70% Еслиби шизофреники били способни видумивать, то што и я 20 тисяч лет тому назад, возможно и люди, достигли би електричества, тисяч десять, лет назад… а сечас, би ми м'ясо виращивали, генномодифицированое, посадил семена в грунт- виросла курица, или теленок Лев да друзя мои, смотрю у вас из Путиним кришу от НЛО сорвало… Орел хто би говорил, скажи єще, што у вас в лабораторіях, нету полуцелих НЛО, кусков НЛО, биологических существ неизвесного происхождениє, ето ти людям макорони на уши вешай, мне можеш не вешать… в нас в москве не менше10 таких существ в секретних лабораторіях находится, так што, хотяби мне не росказивай, а то приглашу мирових експертов, штоб посмотрели на них…. Сделали фото, видео и тест днк, если получится, канешно, некоториє с них, уже по 50 лет в формалине хранятся. А вот етому гаду, информацию, наверно, ктото из Кремля слил так… што даже я, об етом не знаю…     Кошка а ви знаєте, создаєтся впечатлениє, што многиє политики, украини, висунули антени изза ушей, и слушают што им из кремля прикажут… Лев а ето уже не твоє дело, животноє… Арах токо не нужно заверей оскорблять, ви украину розвивать собираєтесь? Лев а ето уже не твое дело… ето дело правительства Орел вот видите, я об етом всем и говорю, постоянно… Собака да ладно вам, нада би договорится.. Цикало блин уже не талько колготки, от смеха мокриє… Лисий слиште, я даже от ще котки никогда так не смеялся, аж живот болит… Кнопкодав а я уже привик за пультом, смеятся всегда, по поводу или без, лиш би било хоч чучуть смішно…. Так што живот у меня не болит, хорошо натренерован…    Лев, в украине свободи слова нет, не било и не будет…. В нас политиков запрещено обсуждать… Оператор канала 24 часа росия, начала спрашивать, ви утверждаєте што в украине нет свободи слова… Лев ти на мою голову, где взялась… Орел снимала репортаж со мной… Лев а почему я ее не видел… Орел, так она била замаскирована под. камень… Лев визовете кто нибуть психіатра… Арах ну пусть возникнет сдесь лутший психіатр страни… Появляется доктор психиатрических наук- дальше просто доктор.. Доктор страная в меня фантазія, нада будет с колегами посоветоватся… Лев обслідуйте их, они душевно больниє… Доктор уважаемий Лев ви жалуєтесь на своє здоровє,??? Лев нет, но они несут полную єрунду… Доктор забавно н опока сам не услишу, не поверю, и покашто єрунду говоритє токо ви… Кошка нервно хихикнула, за спиной у доктора, он ее не видел.. Лев видете уже и кошка с меня ржот… Доктор уважаємий, да ви фантазер, в етот раз собака с мишкой заржали, за спиной в доктора.. Лев видете как? Видите как, себя ети звери, странно ведут, розговаривают и ржут… Доктор уважаемий завтра будем госпитализировать…. Арах доктор извиняюся, ми ево подставили… здесь звери говорят… Доктор и вас в одну палату к нему посадим Кошка доктор и меня если можно… Собака и меня штоб не скучно било… Доктор не прежде чем когото госпитализировать, нада самому  полечится… Лев даже доктора довели….     Орел а че в ребят єсть свій шарм, і свій стиль.. очень даже интересно… Доктор хотите ли версию, што нада делать дальше? Арах доктор послушайте мою версию, психологичного теста, на айкю+ на скоко человек извращенец,.… Доктор давай уже валяй.. всеравно я попал… Арах используєм на друзях, подруге, или друге, колегах по роботе, тест номер 1, Ельза сосала, в рота вставляла, за щеку брала, язиком лизала, двумя руками держала, в рот вставляла, и витягала, сосала, лизала так и уснула…  С чем имела дело Ельза Варианти пустушка, леденец, и так далее, ну в кого што на уме… Доктор боюся многие скажут што член… процентов 20% населения украини, может так сказать…  Арах тест номер 2. Петро давил, петро зажимал, петро трогал, петро напрягался А в ето время женщина кричала петро не дави, петро не зажимай, петро не трогай, петро не нада..  Што делал Петро… Варианти чинил автомобиль, ремонтировал битовой прибор и так далее, человек подсознательно, если не будет думать поставит свій вариант, говорящий о том… на скоко он развращений, или склонен думать… Доктор на слух может показатся што он трогал женщину, но на самом деле, нигде не сказано, што ее ктото трогал, интересно…  Тест номер три.. дмитрий бил, очень сильно бил, от нево веяло злостью, он так сильно бил, што аж слези текли,  в ето время второй мужчина плакал, да я тебя, гада, по судам затаскаю….  Казалось би плевое дело… он мужчину бил… но уви нигде не сказано, што мужчину ктото бил… мужчина Плакал одним словом, но не указуєтся, што его ктоото бил….. да, ему наносили материальний вред… безусловно, к примеру розбивая машину, или розрушая дом… и так далее, тоже тест на айкю… и даже есть вариант што дмитрий бил боксерскую грушу, а второй мужчина совсем по другому поводу плакал, и с дмитрием не связаним…  Тест номер четире алиса любила, ужасно любила, больше всего на свете любила, и в слух об етом говорила… В ето время мужчина говорил, я люблю, невероятно люблю, и об етом говорю.  О чем говорила алиса и о чем говорил мужчина… в полтора года видумал, щас вспомнил.. хи хи… они могли говорить к примеру о друг друге, или же алиса о цветах а мужчина о випивке… и так далее…  Тест номер пять в доме есть дети, они очень баловани, как успокоить детей, если мама одна в доме, а ребенка четире…. При етом маме нада учить уроки, а также все постирать, и сварить кушать, при етом давать игрушки в руки противопоказано, книги в руки давать нельзя, и телевизор тоже нельзя включать, как занять в таком случає четирех детей маме, штоб освободить себе время, если они баловани… и не хотят вместе играть…  Мой вариант… включить музику или подобрать каждому ребенку, партнера для игр с которим он захочет играть… дома в нас 4етире ребенка, но они не играют с друг другом, но ето не значит, што они не играют с другими детьми, одна мама может следить за 20 детьми, пока остальние мами, делают штото по дому… тоесть мами договариваются по очереди «караулить» детей…     Ладно вернемся к сказке… Орел а ето што еще за фигня, не понял… Лев вобще чердак в человека снесло… Доктор мда, контора диагноз пишет… Арах доктора заставте видумать космичний корабль.. Орел  да ти его не сможеш ето заставить, изза того што в нево нет знаний как ево делать,     Арах как получать воду, в сахаре, для создания оазисов.. Лев сахаре, ну ти и фантазер…. Кошка ево идея состоит в том што можно сделать из стекла, сделать огромнуюю герметичную емкость, потом, в етой емкости, в дне делаем патрубок, которий позволит воздуху, из земли входить в ємкость, или же на оборот из емкости, виходить воздуху, в землю…. Решается и вопрос фильтрации за одно, так как вода, которая будет конденсироватся в ємкости будет по сути дистилятом. Тоесть пари води, из грунта ночью, попадают в емкость, изза того што емкость охлаждается, и при етом воздух, максимально насищен водой, в итоге воздух охлаждается до точки роси, и вода виделяется у виде дистилята, и начинает опускатся на дно емкости, если правильно сделать, к примеру в неку водонапорну башту, а отуда использоватся для орошения…. Лев слушай стекло где ти ево возьмеш Собака песок позволял делать стекло, с годами стало ясно, што дествительно стекло с песка можно делать, и уж поверте в сахаре, такого добра, видимо не видимо, вся сахара из дробленого стекла состоит…. Токо розплавить при 1400 градусов, вроде, и потом отлить… Дрозд, даже тупую методику, подгоню, лично для пустини сахари… берем кучу дзеркал…. Собирающие линзи, и емкость из тугоплавкого метала, дзеркалами, направляем солнечний свет, в сторону емкости, а линзами фокусируем, если в солнечних плитках для приготовления пищи температура может виростать до 400 градусов, то на саом деле если все правильно сделать, температуру, можно повисить и до 15тисяч градусов, тоесть расплавить даже базальт, не токо ядерний взрив, способен ево розплавить…     Орел ти говорил об вечной енергии, ви могли би в условиях енерго кризиса ето применить…. Мишка ми би не против ето применить, да в укриани того, критические дни, енергетики чучуть того…. Орел а што с ними, почему чучуть того? Кошка да начинают росказивать што в украине некуда девать уголь, нефть и газ, страние какието… начинают заливать, што им приказ, с верхних слоев государства, не пропускать такиє вещи… Орел ого, а они меня радуют… Собака вот к примеру слишали о грозовой башне тесла, так вот  в араха подсчет, как ее сделать, точнее ее аналог… Лєв да пусть уже чешит, всеравно придется слушать, ниче с етим не поделаеш, можно вопрос, скоко ти уже енергетиков, идеями кумариш? Арах да поди считай из 15го червня 2014 года… как токо обявили кризис  Орел, интересно.. хм интригуєт.. Арах меня не очень, скорее кумарит, идиотом себя чуствую… Лев давай уже росказуй, коль начал тесла ее уничтожил, и никто не повторил…. Не получается впоймать грозу…. Кошка наивние люди, поставили громоотвод, и думают што грозу поймали Мишка хи хи, действительно… они ее токо сквозь него пропустили и думают што могут енергию, забрать… Арах на самом делее, єє нужно по настоящем упоймать, и ето не сложно на самом деле… Лев поймать грозу офигел, ана сразу в землю уйдет…    Арах задайтесь вопросом, а почему она, туда уйдет…. Лиш потому што земля позитивна… и когда молния попадает в громоотвод, в него попадают електрони, он стает более негативним, чем земля и заряд уходит в землю. А теперь представим себе, што земля, оказалась после попадания грози в антену более негативной, естественно гроза останется в антене, вот и все… Орел проще сказать чем сделать… Собака да скорее наоборот проще сделать, вопрос остаєтся каким способом использовать Цикало висшая материя ето чутли не АЛФИЗИКА, аналог АЛХИМИИ,.. Арах будеш смеятся но ето физика для 8 класа школи, закон кулона да и всево то делов… Цикало в смисле… Арах количество заряда зависит от площади, чем больше площадь, тем менше напряжение, штоб снять електрони нада… Орел анука розказуй… Арах допустим есть площадь снятия заряда 10 метров квадратних, штоб снять 10 тищ електронов, нада 5 вольт, а я наглею, и говорю лучше больше площадь сделать и построить пирамиду… Цикало всмисле Арах да в прямом сделать ету площадь не 10 метров квадратних, а к примеру 10км квадратних Цикало и што Арах да так ничево площадь увеличили в 1 млн раз, соответственно для снятия 10 тищ електронов нужно напяжение пошти в 1 млн раз менше.. Цикало и што ето дает… Арах Представим при напряжении 5 вольт посходится на 10 тищ електронов 15 ват електрики в час. Лев ну и што с етого.. Арах а при 10 км квадратних пошти в милион раз менше напряжение нада, хай у 100тисяч соответственно штоб откачать, ети 100тищ електронов, нада потратить в 100 тищ раз менше енергии, а вот когда гроза прилетит она заменит ети 10 тищ електронов своими Цикало и што? Арах напряжение у грози всеволиш 10млн вольт, и мощность 10 млн вольт на 10тищ електронов, просто останется в антене, а ето будет 30 млн ват… Орел не понял, ето как… Кошка елементарна физика, детский сад, ясельна група, вся штука в чем… Когда електрони поглотятся енергия поглотится, єй будет два варианта, виделится теплом, или електромагнитной волной 	Цикало хочеш сказать, што летит гроза, часть електронов поглощать ето виделит енергию, и все в перед она превратится в другой вид енергии, тепловой или електромагнитний… Кошка бери више, зачем поглощать часть грози, если ее можно полностю поглотить.. … Цикало в смисле полностю поглотить Кошка да сково там тех електронов, не так и много… 10 млн ампер в одной молнии время 0.01 секунди, и щитай електрони  ето 10 млн и умноженое на 0.01= 100тищ електронов Цикало знач площадь не 10 км квадратних а сто? Кошка да нет площадь 10км квадратних и напряжение 100 вольт… Цикало а ето зачем… Кошка да штоб електронов всего то не хватало  200млрдов на етой площади  Цикало а зачем, так много… Кошка а затем што тут уже и 1 тисяча молний подряд не убежит…. Цикало ну ето вариант…. Кошка точно не знаем как енергия виделится тепло или електромагнитние волни, нада проверять Орел я так понимаю поймать грозу легко, а в чем проблема? Кошка да проблема ее использовать, но тут хотяби 1% сожрать полезно и то вигодно… ну кпд ожидается до 30% Орел и ви хотите сказать ета фигня заменит нефть и газ Кошка не седим, так понадкушуем, ета фигня в теории мощнее атомной АЕС Орел на скоко? Кошка да до 1 гвата в час точняк может видавать… Орел не понял атомная 10 терават а ета 1 гигават Кошка а может и по путали просто ета пирамида в теории будет давать до 100 раз больше чем АЕС Орел а размер єє тогда какой Кошка висота 0.5-0.8км, и основание 0.4-0.6км на 0.4-0.6км Лисий смотрю бандура будет не малая Кнопкодав, я представляю как в нее ежесекундно будут бить десятки молний… Арах што есть, то есть…. Кнопкодав но ведь ето же не все… Арах ти не понял ето «база» физична основа, какая делаєт етот процес не виртуальним, а реальним Цикало и когда ти ето видумал арах Арах как думаеш все такое видумуют… Цикало єслиб я такое видумивал, бил би не комиком, а физиком…     Арах а я решил в шоубизнес попробивать пробится, когда с етим дюрьмом розгребусь Цикало думаеш розрешили би? ти попал Арах єсли што, претензии не мне, а тем кто обявил енергетический кризиз.. Цикало думаеш к ним обратятся, скажут ти все сам придумал Арах человек не на стоко развитое существо, штоб ето все самом придумать.. Цикало а ето как? Арах нужна команда человек 100, штоб до такого додуматся… и клоун заводила… 	Кнопкодав допустим в вас вишло построить пирамиду, а електрони, ви ебонитовой палочкой, решили забирать, представляю… себе етот процесс… 	Арах нет електронний насос, спертий из НЛО, в росийской федерации… Цикало а розкажи нам, а то ми не знаєм как работаєт Арах да ето електродвигатель, видоизменений… Кошка вобще подойдет трефазний генератор…. Петух все котушки статора, просто, на просто розделяєм, делаєм каждую котушку отдельной Мишка ага и к каждой котушке присоеденяєм конденсатор до 2 фарад емкостю… такой колебательний контур, ужасно чуствителен к магнитним волнам, к двум краям конденсатора ставим диодний мост… колебательний контур дает переменний ток, тоесть на диодном мосту, вход с контура переменний, за диодним мостом конденсатор на 500 фарад емкостю… но там єсть + и-, он способен копить на себе колосальное количество позитивного, и негативного заряда… + нашего контура прикрепляєм к антене через переходник, а –к заземлению… Кошка на плюс уходят електрони из, антени, антена стаєт позитивно заряженой… Собака на минусе лишниє електрони, они уходят в землю… Цикало смотрю ви подготовились?... Арах между антеной, и електроним насосом главноє переходник… Кошка ага, иначе гроза електроний насос спалит… Арах переходник являєт собой стержень, или трубу длини 20-50 метров, диаметра 5-10 метров, из хорошо проводящего електртический ток материала.. вставлену в подобну трубу еще большего диаметра к примеру длина 20-50м диаметр 30-40метров, отцентрирована, между трубами залит електролит колосального сопротивления, или же вещество, способное проводить електроток… после того как отвердеет… но с огромнейшим сопротивлением…. Кошка Нужно сделать так штоб ето сопротивление било меншим, чем если молния, просто попробуєт в центральний войти.. Мишка Тоесть на внешний електрони легко доходят и тут начинаемся… 1 см кв дает 1 гига ом, но по закону физики чем больше площадь тем менше сопротивление  площа 3.14*10м*50м= 1570 метров квадратних, што в сантиметрах квадратних, в 10 тищ раз больше, тоесть 15млн раз упадет сопротивление, и будет около 100килоом…. Но при попитке молнии пройти через одну точку… 1 гигаом… такого типа переходников много ступеней Арах Почему на насосе + и – в нас огромной емкости? Лиш по тому што при напряжении 100вольт, за одну секунду будет перетекать очень маленький ток, 100 вольт делим на 100 ком, ето 0.001 ампера, тоесть паралельно таких, нада поставить… милиони… на самом деле я описал слишком большой переходник…. На самом деле ево размер будет длина 2метра диаметр 20 см, вокруг переходника будет залита вода… когда гроза попадаєт в антену… изза ее колосальной емкости, в нее нет особого желания уходить на електроний насос, и поетому, она фактично полностюю остаєтся в антене… тут играем правило роль… чем више емскость накопления електронного насоса, тем менше он боится грози, при условии што антена имеет колосальну емкость… причина проста. Представим в нас 10 млн електронов на 1 метр квадратний, ми докинули 1000електронов напряжение виросло… Мишка А вот то же самое на 1 метр квадр 10 млн електронов, но площадь 1 км квадр напряжение в милион раз менше добавится при добавке 1000електронов.   Так само и с пирамидой, чем више емкость антени, тем скачек напряжения будет менше, и одновременно с етим чем више емкость електронного насоса, тем тоже скачок напряжения будет падать… тоесть для стабильной пирамиди ТЕСЛА, но так как тесла делал башнюю ми хи ето уже не єво изобретениє Заяц ну вот и я сюда приперся… на внешней сторонє, пирамида пошти полностю покрита «енергетичним» щитом електронов… токо шпиль не покритий…. Вот гроза туда и попадает… в щита негативность на 50 вольт више, чем в земли…. За счет лишних електронов, щит, хорошо изолирован от внутреней позитивной ємкости…. Арах да но щит изолирован и от внешней среди, и фактично не теряет електронов Мишка а еще верхняя позитивная часть пирамида покрита гигантским колпаком, толщини 0.4метра из метала, и растояниє меж колпаком, и позитивной емкостю 10-20 см… Арах ето сделано для того штоб слабие електрические розряди… не проходили в пирамиду….. Хрущ колпак заземлен, через колосальное сопротивление, и слабий статичний заряд, через него, стекает в землю…. При етом молнии, больше нравится пройти колпак насквозь, и зайти в позитивную ємкость….  Ето основной принцип… остаєтся лиш, процесс переработки електричества… из грози… ета фигулина способна поглощать… еще нада перерабативать… Закон сохранения енергии гласит ништо, ниоткуда не возникает, и просто так не исчезает, а лиш превращается с одного вида енергии во второй… тоесть если ми поглотим електрони грози, то скорее всево ето приведет к вибросу, електромагнитной или тепловой енергии больше ни как…     А сечас март 2013 года совещание нимизид, через интернет… «алиса» ребята штото не хорошое может начатся, в меня плохоє предчуствиє «мишка» наверно война с росиєй «арах» думаю проблеми в украине начнутся в начале листопада етого года… «хрущ» и што делать? «алиса» сканери пора ставить… и контролировать, кто, и в каком количестве, на територію украини попадаєт… контрабандистов и так далее не трогайте, все нада тихо сделать… «хрущ» ми поставим три радара со сторони росии, они покажут, кто бил в росии, а оказался в украине «алиса» розрєшаю делайте… «арах» а ви не слишком на радари обнаружения людей росчитиваете? «алиса» да што ти… прикаливаешся, такую фигню кгб, токо начинало иследовать, когда я там работала, в нас єсть шанс провести испитаниє в реальних условиях.. «арах» на скоко он далеко берет…? «алиса» с твоєй области до москви хватаєт свободо, вобще радіус 3 тищи км… гдето так… «мишка» как работаєт ето чудо-юдо…  «алиса» в араха спросите, он знаєт.. ми поняли, што мисли человека, создают електромагнитноє возмущение, передающееся через телефон, при етом в каждого человека своя излучающая частота, как отпечатки пальцев, можно за любим слідить, и не догадается, за кем угодно, хоть президентом.. найти можно кого хочеш, штоб система могла найти точное местонахождения нада три радара, один на востоке, чернигов, один на півдні, миколаїв, один на півночі, рівне… будет извесно передвижениє всех людей в ради усе 2тищ км, от етого треугольника… «арах» блин ето фантастика в мире фантастики… «алиса» ти еще етот момент опишеш… «арах» ти о чем?...» а можно мне к вашим присоеденится… «алиса» нам и так много 8 тисяч человек уже собрали…, если обявят енергетический кризис… ми так узнавали… они зачемто информацию, не стали сохранять… даш украинским чинам перла,      Май 2013 года через интернет… «заяц» ми с «хрущем» проверили радари, работают…. Правда не всегда отличают человека от животного…. «алиса» очень хорошо ми завозим оружин из складов кгб на места… не рослаблятся… «арах» ви же берете из украинских складов заметять… «алиса» в КГБ били собствениє склади о котрих иногда, даже СБУ не знаєт у нас таких два десятка… по 500тищ оружия «арах» шутите? «алиса» говорю, потому што ти об етом в своє время ляпнеш, уж поверь.. а вот єсть оно или нет, пусть потом голову ламают.. «мишка» зачем? «алиса» так нада…     Сентябрь 2013 года «алиса» арах ти готов? «арах» к чему готов? «алиса» понятно вернемся к етому вопросу позже…    Декабрь 2013 года  «мишка» пипец на майдане меня чуть не затоптали… «алиса» ти чего туда полезла дура, не твое ето дело… «арах» слушайте я хочу к вам на майдан… «алиса» еще один идиот, жить надоело??? Не вздумай… «арах» я тоже, хочу, штото сделать…. «алиса» придумивать, ето твоя задача, твоє особоє заданиє, а с остальним, и без тебя справятся…      Март 2014 года  «мишка» хех януковича єли спекалися… «алиса» капец дурная девка, по моєму даже под. пули лезла… «мишка» а што я должна стоять и смотреть? «алиса» тебе хоть кажи, хоть не кажи, што тебе не делай, по своєму делаєш… «арах» можно я к вам, присоеденюся «алиса» ти своїм занимайся, тренеруйся придумивать, врядли кто поверит, што ето один человек сумел придумать,       Сентябрь 2014года «алиса» арах ну ти всех и в печатлил… «арах» я чужу капец… «заяц» я читал твои мисли, даже я читая твои мисли, начал сомневатся што ти с етой планети, не преведи бог, ето би увиділи психіатри, как ти тренеровался придумивать ету гадость, где ти информации навикапивал….. што за тупа методика, содавать діалоги токо в голос… «хрущ» я тоже поверил што ти інопланетянин, ппц ето бомба, отпад, блин читаю мисли, то што ти навидумивал, из интернета и книг, ето писдец…  «алиса» представ што будет, если ето использовать, ето будет писдей на холодець… «заяц» ну не знаю, арах об’ясни, какого хрена ти видумивал в голос… «арах» бля ребята, я пока натренеровался видумиват, хуйню, пошти два года, уже тренеруюся постоянко, токо сечас, вот овладел, придумивать єболу, не озвучивая єє в голос, етому било нє реально, научится, зато тепер, я как дресерованая твар, такоє заєбашу, што потєряются, и будуть ржать… «алиса» определися потеряются или ржать… «арах» три в одном… потеряются+ охуєют+будут ржать….     Декабрь 2014 года  «алиса» «арах» ти говориш што надресерован, ану сочини стирок об НЛО… «арах»  стишок «інопланетна королева»…  Іншопланетна королева, досить гарна жінка, Проте нехай вас не обманить, зовнішня краса, Котра ховає надміцний характер, Її воля міцна, а розум ясний, вона ясновидець, Побачити здатна, що було, що є, і що буде,  Та сталася з нею біда, зрада в державі була, Вона це відчула, й втекла, не тому що боялась, А мала мету, сховати на землю, рідну дочку, Домовилась, бідна із КГБ, проте вона не знала, Яку біду, вона дала дочці, залишив лиходіям,  Дитині, правду не сказали, від неї правду приховали, Але біда не за горами, хай НЛО прибуде з нами…   «мишка» токо глядь така не етим стишком, ти што гониш, по другом… «алиса» чуствую, бившем КГБ, пора жопу готовить, их будет НЛО опускать… ни один отдел не додумался правду сказать, даже наший, не придумал своїм ляпнуть, пока нас «мишка» за гриву не взяла, сиділи на рослабонє, с дєньгами на карманє, думали, никто нє когда не узнаєт, а она хвост нам красиво прищемила…. «мишка» не нада благодарностей, всє прекрасно, нє так ли…. «алиса» сначала думали, а может в могилу зарить…. Но она нас наєбала… сказала так и так допустим ви мєня убєтє, но друзя солют, инфу об етом нло, и будет вам повна пизда… подумали подумали, а ну его нахуй, вернули корабль, и 10% от денег, коториє в ниє спиздили в 1985году, там бил милиард доларов, а на момент, требувания денєг, било токо, 100милионов… остача в заводах и фабриках, ета коза, забрала, наличку, и сказала, с меня денег хватит…. Пошти во всех таких деток, дома стояли спарениє телефони… точнее двойниє линии… одна линия обична… а втора линия, на нее виход бил через 0000 на правитєльствену атс, по СССр… хотитє вертє, хотитє нет, а могли и генсеку дозвонится…    Март 2014 года «алиса» слушай арах начинай сволоч сказку писать, время пришло, писака хренов… «заяц» сделай по возможности так, штоб все ржали, и типа анекдот… Женщина вечно в обиде, как токо берет виходной, штоб пойти на город, постоянко дождь идет, а вот в соседки всегда хорошая погода…. Она к ней как у тебя так получаєтся… а она договорилась с начальством… если нада виходной, с утра беру… А утром, смотрю на домашний погодомер… та што в обиде, а как ето… Та с утра по ранше смотрю на член мужа в лево хорошая погода, в право плохая, а по средине переменная, облачность… первая, а вот єсли стоит… вторая а если стоит, нафиг та робота, нафиг той город, для меня великий празник… «арах» бистро же ти перектрутил, тот анекдот што мне росказали.. «заяц» наука о виварачивании на изнанку, словами, тоже искуство… и ето смішно… «мишка» ну ви и дурачки… «алиса» а то, ти што, сомнєвалась… «мишка» о давайте пердставим, што скажет СБУ если им прити и сказать, што они скажут, если прити в отдел дознания СБУ… «волк» здраствуйте я пришол к вам, я недавно общался со страними людьми, ви можете мне помоч.. «заяц» здраствуйте ето очень інтересно, но есть ли у вас свидетели, записи розговоров, записи видео, и прочиє доказательства… «мишка» здраствуйте мне нужна ваша помощ, ви можете мне помоч,? «алиса» а в чем именно дело? «мишка» мне прдложили участвовать в теракте… «алиса» предоставте пожалуйста доказательства, што вам предложили участвовать в теракте… «мишка» все доказательства можно получить, прослухав мой номер, телефона… «алиса» хорошо ми переданим ето нашим специалистам, и они сделают ето… «арах» здраствуйте, служба безопасности украини мне может кто нибуть помоч… «хрущ» вийдете пожалуйста на улицу, на 10 минут, к нам пришли інформатори ви их видете, им нада передать нам информацию…     Вернемся к казочкам…  Орел огого я не знал, об етих дирах, мама дорогая, блин че я ими не воспользовался… Арах Орел, а готови ли ви заключить сделку… наши условия, максимально бистро, прекратить войну, условиє номер один, прекратить немедленно, в течении ближайшего времени поставку войск в украину, допустим ми вам верим, што ваших войск там нет, просьба закрить в том раєне, по настоящем границу, штоб никто не заєхал… ето ведь можно… Орел да и в меня нет другой мисли…. К чему ви ведете… Арах вот смотрите давайте договоримся, хотите воевать делайте ето политически а не физически… во первих, ето вредно для Росии, не говоря об Украине… Орел в чем вред для росии по вашому… Арах наши видали свій прогноз, єсли Росія продовже війну з Україною, вона почне розпадатися сама по собі 2016 рік відішлеться санкт-петербург, ростов, курськ, и єще два региона, как отдельноє государство… на 2017 рік росією може залишитися лише московська область… но процес єще не начался, и покашто, можно избежать роспада росии, с помощю войск, не вийдет остановить розпад, солдати не станут стрелять в незнакомих людей лиш потому, што попруться защищать, своїх родних, от таких же, как и он, котрим дали приказ, стрелять на поражениє в демонстрантов… у вас люди близки к той точке, необратимости, когда они готови, к тому, штоб отсоєденится от Росии… проводили опрос интернетом из стат анализа вивели из 100% подерживаєт войну 10%, не подерживают 40%, не определилися 30%, хотят отделится 20%..... в том году статистика била иная 40% подерживали, неопределилися 50% и не подерживали 10% Орел што ето значит? Арах єсли война продолжится прогнози о роспаде сбудутся… но будуще не однозначне… ево нельзя сказать што будет только так а не иначе… ето лиш, вариант, если война не прекратится… вам рекомендуют, перевести єє на політичну арену… ви думаєте в нас организация токо украинци, ошибаетесь 10 тищ росяне, и 100 человек украинци… сказать што вот во всю все болеют за украину, не видно… тут украинские в основном, но вот не тни одного не смотря на противоречия в нас мех. Украинолюбами и росиєлюбами, кто би сказал, ета война хорошо… ни одного… то єсть ниодин человек єє не подерживаєт… Орел вам не нравится моя політика? Арах во многом, ви прави, кроме войни… ето я признаю, ето правда, в нас проблем, више криши, и нада их решать, может и погарячилися што в ЄС пошли, может, но тем не менєє, ето вибор людей, и согласитесь, страна сможет устоять, лиш в том случає, єсли єє подерживаєт єє кит, народ… если народ не подерживаєт… из нутри розвалится… Орел складно росказиваеш, красиво, розкладуєш, до сольно падать… Лев да етот вискочка мне надоел…     Арах в росии есть свій клоун затейник, котрий женщин журналистов, обозвал лесбіянками, или как то так… в украине, боюся, мне придерся стать клоуном… правда в меня ума, назвать лезбиянками не хватит, но цирк, на дроте, тоже может бить красивим… Орел ладно тут нада подумать, в другой момент я би на тебя внимания не обратил, но того што ти витворяєш, вроде єще никто не делал..     Я укладиваю новий договор меж Росиєй, Украиной и США, и мной… роялті, будет делится между нами поровну по 25%. Я как носитель…не имею обязательств… как я их буду тратить… куда я захочу, и вобщем то четире владельца, виходит АРАХ, США, Украина, Росия, никто не может продать патент… казалось би ем право власності втратиться, после поширення інтернетом, без оприлюднення  оценили шанс такого… на самом деле в етом творе уже указано кто єсть правовласником… єдинственоє правовласникам нада согласится на то, што они согласни на ето в течении трех лет… я стаю автоматично подтвержденим, правовласником, как токо одно из государств, подтвердит што правовласник… всем троим государствам, извесно, моє настоящее имя… Тем боліє на што росии жалуватися, єсли єє решили в нафтогазову блокаду, поставить, і ніколи не куплять не нафти не газа… а так из доли от роялті росия может в итоге и при блокадє нормально прожить, штука в том, што для того, штоб на етом получать, дєньги, єй придерся и разробативать ети идеии самим… Не думаю, што ктото, сопрет, для патентования… и хотя ето и не по правилам, башня тесла по сути изобретениєє патента на нее нет, а открита наново ета идея, в етих держав, будет два варианта принять, или нет… ем вся фигня в том што все держави нехотят такоее вводить сами, надеюся ужее введеное подтвердить хватит? Если ктото будет видвигать претензии, што в вас небило, етой идеи, на момент оприлюднення, скажите што била утечка информации, после утечки ета информация может бить зарегестрирована тайной службой страни, в какой била информация… «алиса» сказала можно и так, єсли по другом, ни как….     торпеда субмарина, ето микро субмарина которая может погружатся в воду она может плавать на поверхности, видвигать магнити, и магнитами, цеплятся за корабль, дрейфуя вместе с ним скоко єй влезет… или пока не поступит сигнал взорватся, иними словами может плить с кораблем, даже пол. Года…. И люди о ней не будут знать, єсли осли не виявлят. Магнити, котрими креняться когут сдвигатся полюсами друг к другу што делает єє магнитно нейтральной…     Вообще все ето соочинениє пренадлежит мне, сша, росии и украине, и если што не запатентировано, они могут подать на патент… кстати может кто не знаєт, идеи тоже можно патентовать, если в них єсть фізична обоснованость, как в пирамиди грози… то єсть, как ето, идея как поймать грозу штоб наверняка я дал, и ето дествительно так… Осталося доработать процес преобразования енергии… Техноцентр ето всегосударственное обєдинениє, в котороє люди, тем же макаром, што и я отдают свои идеии, єсли будет из идеии роялті.. часть идет создателю идеии, а часть идєт государству…. Тесть государству вигодно обработать идеии людей, а не токо питатся розработать самим…  техномондрий, екстрасенс, котрий бил виявлен генетично в воздасте до 1 года, и бил подвергнут, мультипликационному обучению, технологият с 1-2 лет, фільми с технологиями,       «скаут» це гібрид легкої бронемашини, і техніки на повітряній подушці… тобто є так звані повітряні подушки, потрібна легка броня… і зброя зверху… Повітряна подушка… як уже в існуючих пушка теж, а як полегшена броня? Зовнішній шар… 0.4мм броня вольфрамовий плюс титановий метал, поверхня зовні вольфрам 0.2мм з середини 0.2 мм титан…. Фальшива броня за 20 см над основною бронею… її призначення ослабляти силу удару куль…. Кулі пробивають її, але, при цьому їхня швидкість сильно падає, якщо напалм, попаде на поверхню фальшивої броні, він її не розплавить… вольфрам плавиться при 3500 град цельсія, напалм горить при 3100 здається, а відповідно бронетехніка не буде грітися… хтось скаже, снаряд попаде, рознесе фальшиву броню, вибачаюся снаряд рознесе і основну броню, танка… Під фальшивою бронею, легка броня бронемашини, 2мм кевлавру, 1 мм титану, 2мм кевлавру, 1мм титану, 2мм кевлавру, 1мм титана итого пошти 10мм товщина брони… Што даєт скаут теоретично, такі бронемашини, можуть мати швидкість пересування по землі та по воді від 200 до 500км на годину. Так броня досить слабка, проте кулі кулеметів вона зупинить…. Теоретично, скаута можно довести до такого запасу пересування, що він, зможе перетнути навіть тихий океан, уявіть собі появу легкої бронетехніки, яка мчить зі швидкістю 500км на годину, по морю… за скільки вона перетне, тихий океан, від росіїї до сша, чи навпаки… і попробуй, но її догнати, без вертольота, танком не доженеш… броня слаба, зате неймовірно швидка… і по суті всюдихід…. Атаки з моря, по болоту і так далі… Так доречі умова для росіїї, та сша якщо вони починають війну проти будьякоїї країни, на протязі 10-25 років роялті не виплачується їм, захищатися можно, за це немає штрафу… це щоб не починали війни раз за разом…. А то аж занадто люблять….      Теорія атомів…. Уявіть що ми знаємо про атом… склад, нейтрон, протон, електрон, ядро складається із протона і нейтрона, а навколо ядра, обертається електрон… … атоми, випромінюють, енергію, лише хвильової природи, тобто світлові хвилі, електромагнітні, і теплові хвилі…. Чому так ви проміння енергії атомом, відбувається лише шляхом, переходу електрона, з більш великої орбіти, на більш малу орбіту. В фантазіїї можуть бути абож окремі атоми, або всі атоми, випромінюють електромагнітні хвилі, над малої довжини хвиль, і ці хвилі, теоретично, можно поглинати, з допомогою резонансного контура… це як радіприймач, але для ел магн хвиль випромінюваних атомами, а з допомогою мікроелектроніки та конденсаторів, мікроенергіїї, збирати в потужну енергію…     гіпер простір, або ж по іншому ефір… відкривається з допомогою, ел магнітних хвиль, певної довжини… а також, що існує дуже велика кількість таких просторів, і один з цих просторів накопичує в собі енергію, зірок, а ще один накопичує в собі нафту, прикол, єсли ето правдой окажется…. Открил підпростір, набрал нафти, скоко нада, закрил єво… сам ржу не могу. Вдруг ето правдой окажется от регистрации фантазии в свою пользу, государство, ниче не теряєєт, даже єсли не правда… а єсли правда, скоко ето денег с роялті… почему ето может бить правдой… дело в том што пошти никто не говорит.. но пошти все нєфтегазовиє родовища, вирабативаємиє до 1980 года били полностю виро батани, до конца, нефти там небило вообще, а через 10 лет, они снова начали бить… оказавшись пошти полностю набраними нефтю… так вот, первоє, нефти небило… второє из науки, извесно… што нефть образуєтся милиони лет, а тут «чудо» наповнилося родовище неф тю, пошти полностю, и физики нифига не когут об’яснить, говорять развє што с некого ефира, так вот я расказиваю теоретично с какого ефира… точнее одного из видов підпростору наповненого нафтою… инопланетяне к примеру туда качают нафту, и нам обустроили, внутр. Родовищ, систему, по викачке нафти из єфира…      стержні нікола тесла…. Це антена зроблена з феромагнітної труби, поглина магнітні хвилі, в середині антена стержень, що випромінює ел магнітні хвилі теорія…. В нас внутрішня антена, випромінює наприклад 100ват…. А зовнішня поглина 90% цих хвиль…. А також поглинаються хвилі з навколишнього середовища…. башта магнітних хвиль, висота 500 метрів, а ширина та товщина 50м*50 метрів… електромагнітні хвилі попадають на башту, наводиться потік електронів, і витягується резонансним контуром… модифікований ел магн генератор… в середині  фальшивого ротора знаходиться якорь, наприклад діаметру 30 см довжини 10 метрів, якорь, крутиться в середині труби навколо труби, налитий рідкий магніт… коли ми провертаємо магніт, ротор, це приводить, до повертання полюсами часток рідкого магніту, в теорії це дозволя створити на діаметрі 2м довжині 10м, гармонійну зміну, магнітного поля, якщо будемо гармонійно, з одною швидкістю, крутити внутрішній ротор… А навколо зовнішнього ротора, котушки, перетворені на резонансні контури…, якщо вдасться створити, резонанс, частоти зміни поля з частотою контурів, це дозволе отримувати енергію….     виплавлення рубіну та сапфіру… набираємо глинозему, алюміній два оксисен три… в величезну ємність із вольфраму…. Все це в боксі, що зберіга тепло, гріємо ємність до 2500 градусів цельсія доки весь глинозем не розплавиться, вичікуємо кілька днів, і починаємо охолоджувати…до температури на 10 градусів вище температури плавління, досить швидко, при температурі на 10 градусів вище температури плавління замєдляємо падіння температурне падіння до 1 градуса за одну годину.. при температурі на 0.2 градуса вище температури плавління фактично зупиняємо охолодження, 0.2 градуси за добу, при температурі плавління витримуємо тиждень, при цьому, насправді охолоджуємо на три градуси за тиждень, якщо об’єм не великий, якщо великиу витримуємо довше, після цього охолоджуємо по 2 градуса на добу до температури 2000 градусів, після чого охолоджуємо по 1 градусу, за п’ять хвилин, якщо об’єм малий, теоретично рубіни по даному принципу можно робити вагою в 300млн тон… між рубіном і сапфіром різниця лише в хім. Елементі, що дає забарвлення. Не знаю, мені сказали наші так, што што а рубини и сапфіри ми научились из твоєй идеи делать…. Хотя можно било би и самим научится…. Там легко, нада процес розложить на детали…. Похожая идея как делать алмази весом в 100тон…. Ето умолчююю, не без користи для себя, все роздумую, как себе, производство алмазов начать….     над велика ємність для збору води за рахунок перепаду температур… ширина ємності 400 метрів, довжина ємності 2км висота ємності 200м об’єм ємності 160млн куб метрів повітря… рекомендовано пустеля сахара вихід води на добу близько 500тон….  Як ємність працює… в нижній частині ємності, зроблені жолоби, по яким збирається вода.. в труби…. Які є вобонапарною баштою, по суті…. Забір води, один раз на добу…. Між 4-6 годинами ранку, коли найхолодніше…. Система охолодження ємності представлена зовнішніми радіаторами, тобто ребрами для теплообміну, а також… пасивним теплообмінним контуром… внутрі дуже велика кількість труб, наповнених рідиною, дуже підвищена площа теплообміну, з’єднано трубами із зовнішніми трубами із підвищеним теплообміном… Що відбувається вдень, зовнішні труби, нагріваються набагато швидше, ніж внутрішні… тепло йде вгору, і входить в ємність, в ємності повітря холодне, воно охолоджує рідину, нагріваючись,  після охолодження рідина падає вниз…. І через нижній вихід іде на зовні, так створюється замкнуте коло нагрілась-перейшла-охолодилась-перейшла-нагрілась… і так далі… доки температура в середині ємності не стане рівною температурі зовнішній, процес передачі тепла припиниться, вночі знаву передача тепла але уже із ємності на зовні…. Виходить що вдень, ємність, видихає повітря із себе… при цьому ми лише потратились на систему, а решту дозволяємо, робити матінці природі… вночі вдиха повітря… так як повітря з досить великої глибини грунту, воно близько до грунтових, вод, але, труба не в грунтових водах, а за 1-3 метра вище… грунтових, вод…. Грунтові води це розчини солей і всякої нечистоти, що попада, в грунт, а ми таким чином отримуємо первинний дистилят… грунтових вод… коли система видиха повітря, воно нагріває грунт біля грунтових вод, він насичується вологою… коли система вдихає повітря, повітря насичене вологою, входить в систему, і на стінках охолоджуючих частин… утворюється конденсат… конденсат спочатку, збирається в жолобки та стікається в водозбірні труби…. Ця система пасивно дистилює грунтові води…. Досить цікаво. І електрики не треба… і дозволяє в пустелі сахарі, отриму вати воду, на місці споживання, створюючи поряд штучні оазиси, котрі поливаються від таких систем…. Це вигідніше ніж вести кількох тисячний водогін…. В кілометрах від найближчої прісноводної річки…..     єсли не будет никаким способом получатся, загнать технологиіі, і так далее, через государствениє структури, нада заганять через інтернет в виде сказки рекомендація украине Первоє єсли не умеете, сами вести бізнес, предприятия государства очень чахлиє, и живут токо на дотаціях, давайте как пошти все ети предприятия проданим часному бизнесу… они не будут росчитивать што все недостачи будут покрити из бюджета страни, уж поверте на слово…. Ато виходит как то смішно, зачастую государствене предприятиє, продаєт на 100 млн при етом, штоб зготовить, тратит 150 милионов, єсли, би на оборот, тога без базара потратили 100млн а продали на 150 млн, вигода била би. А так виходит, к примеру што люди, виплачивая налоги, винуждени платить за то, што гос предприятия нерентабельни…. Второє раз государствениє предприятия продукции не рентабельни, сделаєм давайте, хай даже не рентабельниє предприятия по повишению ВВП в стране, вот такоє, предприятиє, вигодноє, даже будучи не рентабельним, налоги ево подерживают, он производит оборудованиє, для производства, ето оборудованиє продается в кредит по специальном договору, што с етого оборудования долино бить уплочено налогов в 10 раз більше к примеру, чем вам продают ето оборудования, так как вам продали ето оборудованиє по цене 25% от себестоимости… Тесть 25%*10=250% долино купившее предприятиє отдать у виде налогов, а пока оно не отдаст, не имеет никому права продать свою фабрику, и обв’язано работать, или же компенсировать государству часть стоимости оборудования, или вернуть оборудование государству… там можно покрутить так штоб ти купил оборудованиє стоящее 2 млн, по контракту… за 500тищ в кредит… уплатив налогов, на 5 млнов, контракт розривається и оборудованиє на всегда твоє.. Вариант три давайте продавать оборудованиє предприятиям по контрактуу по цене себестоимость+25% от себестоємости но в безпроцентниє кредити, а процентами по кредиту станут виплачениє налоги.. кредит от 2до 10 лет…. Деньги с кредитов, возвращаются в кредитний банк, также постоянно, в кредитний банк, добавляются деньги с бюджета, и сумма в кредитном банке наростає и с каждим годом, банк видаєт в кредит, все більше и більше, асортимент товаров рекомендує мий Украине…. Електро-велосипеди(смесь велосипеда и електроцикла, велосипед улучшений, тем што добавлен електромоторчик на 200-800гц, через редуктор, и облегченний силовой акумулятор. Когда моторчик вращается он крутит звездочку, если не вращается… система как у заднего колеса велосипеда…. Крутиш педали… даеш увеличение скорости, не крутиш педали, всеравно едеш… тесть крутится моторчик и ти крутиш ваше совмесное усилие сумиряється.., можеш также крутить или ти сам или токо електромоторчик, для лінтяїв.), Второє … наладить класниє заводи, што производят заводи, для производства продукции, и произведениє заводи продавать… иними словами, государство может продавать заводи в виде конструктора, собери завод из проданого тебе оборудования, или даже уже собраниє заводи, и даже проверили… токо покупай и работай…, также украине рекомендовано строить «скаути», какоє вооружениє в теории может нести «скаут» первує пулемети, второє легкую артилерію, и третеє мини ракети…. Или к примеру…. Установки которие иногда на вертолети цепляют, запускают подряд до 100 миниракет…. А также залповие установки град…. Немножко модифицирование, накривающие вместо 4 га площади 0.5-1 га площади и стреляющие на чуть меньшее ростояниє… и так далее вобщем не очень тяжолоє оружиє… тактика боя скаутами… иза своєй линии оборони, даєш залп по противнику, скаут затариваєтся боєприпасами, в тилу, после чего по бистрому, приближається к линии фронта, скорость скаута 200-500км в час… даєт залп, по противнику, и убирається в тил… то єсть приперся- дал залп – смился… ето не «крисиная» методика, как ктото скажет… ето тактика позволяєт каждий раз стрелять из новой точки, а вот под. каким углом стрелять можно підключить ДЖИПЕС навигацию, танков, и определение по джипиес откуда стреляли, и как попали, джипиес ето позволяєт… и соответственно джипиес позволяєт машине, вистрелить в точку, отехать в бок и попасть в ту же саму точку, еще на километр отєхать и попасть в ту саму точку, если имеется джипиес можно стрелять с любой удобной нам точки, при етом противнику, будет проблема, вот он пристрелился… ми стреляли с запада к примеру 45град от запада в напряму південний захід…. Он готовится туда залп дать… а нас уже там нет и второй залп ми дає миз запада 10град но уже напрям північний захід, да и растояниє, с какого ми стреляли он не знаєт, плюс ми дали залп, и делаем «ноги».. Плюс скауту, што движучись, в принципе, он может смится от атаки бомбардировщика, ну в теории точно может… также может запускать в воздух штото на подоби сигнальних ракет, используя их как тепловиє лопушки, на коториє перенаправится ракета, с тепловим наведеним…       Што єще я рекомендую украине призводить, силовиє акумулятори … што можно спаивать меж собою, к примеру цинкову и медну пластину… и ето правда,  и што можно набирать єти пластини как стопку бумаги , и ето правда, и што можно меж пластинами, посположить шар пропитаного електролитом, материала, а по краям ізолятор, не дающий витекать електролиту, за предели пластини… и ето правда, такая система, позволяєт подряд набирать по 500 таких листов, и ето правда… и между двумя листами будет напряжениє 1.5 вольт и ето правда.. то єсть акумулятор на 750 вольт… и ето правда.. И што ширина таких пластин может бить 40 см а длина 60 сми по 1см по краям изолята…. Ето правда.. площадь обмела електронами 38*58 см и ето правда.. площадь ел обмела… 2200см квадратних и ето правда 10 см квадр дает 1-2,5 ампер, и ето правда мощность акумулятора 22 ампера* 750 вольт…16.5 квт не так и слабо…\ Какая товщина пластин в акумуляторе, крайняя первак и крайняя последняя однометаличная…. Между ними стопка сверхтонких двуметаличних…. Чем менше товщина, двуметаличних тем можно щитать менше длина соєденяющего акумулятори проводника и менше сопротивлениє акумулятора… а чем більше площадь пластини, тем більше товщина, проводника соєденяющего акумулятори….. Какиє можно делать биметаличниє пластини…. Товщини от 0.01мм к примену, из прослойками ел лита 0.01мм, тесть в 1 мм  вместится 45-50 акумуляторних батарей то єсть 1 мм будет давати напряжениє 70-80 вольт…. А к примеру діаметр батарейки 6мм, діаметр площади ел обмена 5мм, ток 0.01-0.08 ампера… и в батарейке діаметром 6 мм товщини 4 мм напряжение 200-300 вольт а ток 0.01-0.08 ампера…. Такую батарейку, хоть в нее малий запас времени работи, очень вигодно использовать… к примеру вставить в пулю, вместе с чипом преобразующим, постояний ток в переменний, прицепить конденсатор, огромной ємкости..но очень малого розмера…, один из концов конденсатора крепом и к чипу, и к корпусу пули…. Второй конец конденсатора, токо к чипу… ето позволит електросистеме, создавать на поверхности пули перемену напряжоность електрополя, к примеру когда пуля в патроне, кнопка, соеденяюща контакти не нажата… поетому батарейка не теряєт заряд, когда ми стреляєм, пуля виталкивается зади п’ятачок, у пули втапливаєтся внутр., нажимая кнопку, замикається контакт… електроток идет на чип, таймер чипа отсчитуєт 1-3 секунди, и начинаєт после етого,  появляться на поверхности пули… переменноє напряжениє 180-250 вольт и тока 0.008-0.05ампер…. По другому ето називається пуля, електрошок… Если пуля попала в тело, не сломавшися… она будет бить електрошком…     НЛО внешняя часть корпуса сделана из фольфрама…. Ее задача входя и виходя из атмосфери, а также в атмосфере нагреватся…. Когда температура доходит до определеной точки начинаєт светится… по етому ми видим как НЛО светится…. Под. етим слоєм с прошарком в 10 см воздуха или вакуума, находится дзеркальная поверхность фальшивого корпуса, в которой находится испаритель хладрогена…. Котрий охлаждаєт дзеркало… Суть в чем вольфрам нагрелся и излучаєт всет, во все сторони… дзеркало возвращаєт свет назад на вольфрам… но оно всеравно греется поетому хладроген ево охлаждаєт…. Под. дзеркалом находится сверхпрочний корпус с «килхация» титана, в котрого кристалічна решотка как в алмаза….   Герб корабля триелектроний атом, в фотоархівах СССР нашли фото етого корабля а я скому- скомуниздил, часть ескизов, как ето чудо техники работаєт… Оружиє	 корабля… двести рейових електромагнітних гармат….стреляющих снарядами діаметром 20-30 мм, діаметр ствола гармати 1метр… длина ствола 1км…. Скорость вилета снаряда из ствола от 5км за секунду до 1000км за секунду… скорострельность, 2 вистрела за секунду с одной гармати… тип боєзаряда… снаряда… тактическая атомная бомба… клас корабля осадний, тип среднего типа, весс 200млн тонн Способен стрелять без остановки до 30 минут… тактика боя, корабль виходит на орбиту планети… розварачиваєтся в сторону цели, так как стволи, вдоль всего корабля…  ми так подщитивали, на нашей планете нет оружия, способного противостоять даже одному такому кораблю… не говоря што их когут бить милиони…     Електромагнитная гармата описаниє боєзаряда состоит из гильзи діаметр внешний 1метр, длини до 5 метров товщина до 2 см, тип материала, феромагнетик…. В гильзе закрепяєтся… снаряд… діаметр 20-30см длини 1метр, тип боєзаряда сверхмощная ядерная бомба, по другому тактична ядерна бомба… после вилета из ствола , снаряд начинаєт опережать гильзу…. И отделяєтся от нее…. Смішно…. Как устроєна електромагнітна гармата… діаметр внутренего ствола, 1метр ето так називаемий фальшивий ствол…, матеріал, феромагнетик товщина труби 20 см, в трубе нарезани канали 12 штук, продольние на всю длину труби… ширина канала 50мм, глубина канала 40мм они предназначени для того, што даже єсли стрелять, сполошним снарядом, не будет так називаемого сопротивления воздуха… в отличиє от обичних видов оружия, где нужна максимальная притертость и герметичность ствола… здесь… нужно на оборот, штоб била притертость, но ни в коем случає не било герметичности, поскоку, електромагнитная гармата не используєт сжатих газов, для стрельби, и в принципе позволяєт, розганять чутли не до скорости света… принцип устроения котушки шлейфовий, тесть наматуєм, как катушку, шлейф, в котрого один край соеденяєм в єдиний минус к примеру в шлейфе 1000проводов диаметра 2мм, длина шлейфа 100метров, наматуєм, вокруг ствола діаметром 1 метр… к примеру… один край в нас соеденен в єдиний минус, а вторая част шлейфа, присоедена к усилите лям сигнала… которие запитани на источник питания, плюс много конденсаторов, електро ток пойдет по котушке токо если поступит сигнал… на усилитель, а обачно там идет сверхмалий електроток.. но все же идет… тесть нужен процесов управления…. Котушку заливаєм стандартним машинним маслом…. Смішно но так будет бистрее теплообмін… и с помощу труб испарителя хладрогена забираєм тепло…  котушки греются во время стрельби…    Спорим, я знаю метод, как розогнать, некотору точку, до скорости… к примеру 10 тисяч скоростей света…. Теоретично… ето точно будет именно так, на практике, єдинственноє што етого не позволит… в материала не хватит прочности…. Допустим ми очень постарались…. И у вакуме научилися… розганять крайню точку, ротора етектродвигателя…. До 0.1 скорости света…. Діаметр ротора 2 метра….. так вот єсли ми к валу ротора… присоєденим диск діаметром 10 метров то его окружность, будет в 25 раз більше… суть в том што при вращении 2метрового ротора, крайній точки… со скоростю 0.1 от скорости света… то ротор вражається с некоторим количесвом оборотов за секунду… єсли при етом, в нас жостко прикреплен диск большего діаметра, он вражається с той же скоростю, в радіанах, изза етого што длина окружности диска в 25 раз більше скорость вращения крайній точки будет 2.5 скорости света….. многиє считают што скорости више, чем скорость света, нє возможно сделать, а я пишу што в теории точно можно, матеріал не видержит, відцентрова сила рознесе…  но теоретично ми можем розганять диск діаметром 200км, с помощю ротора діаметром 2 метра, а почему нет…. Если не будет трения и других сопротивлений, можно… тесть длина окружности диска в 10 милиардов раз більше, чем у ротора… если крайня точка ротора… крутится 0.1 скорости света, то у крайній точки диска теоретично, может бить скорость 1милиард скоростей света…. Єсли в космосє зафигачить таку установку, можно научится атаковать атоми, не електронами, розогненими в Європейской електронной трубе, а к примеру 200килограмовими болванками… и скорость света, не предел…. К примеру, можно зафигачить диск… діаметром 100тисяч км, а ротор, розкручивающий єво діаметром 1 метр, и крайню точку ротора розогнать до 0.6 скорости света… когда крайня точка діаметра ротора достигнет 0.6 скорости света…  то крайня точка диска розгонится.. до скорости… в 10 * 10 в степени 11 раз більше, чем 0.6 скоростей света… то єсть до 6*10 в 11степени скоростей света…. Єсти таку установку… собрать не по далеку от солнца, и попасть в сонце, болванкой в 1 тисячу тон, то скорее всево, ево или рознесет на кусочки…. Или оно, вообще покинет предели нашой солнечной системи, я предупреждал спецслужби, єсли меня похерят, виложу в интернет… теорію, как можно уничтожить сонце…. По ходу не поверилииии… а зря… как говорила «алиса»  єсли вдруг, би существовала фізика, по уничтожению об’єктов, то доктора наук в етой физике, я би получил ….     Єсли в Украине без таких сказочок, нельзя заставить вращатся, государственую систему, то вопрос, в каком государстве ми живем, в етом Путин уви прав, в нашем государстве, мнєниє людей совершенно не интересуєт, просто на просто… и как токо майдан росходится, все возвращаєтся на круги своя… в етом он все таки прав… што бил майдан, што єво не било, разници до и после… в отношении государства к людям, лично я не заметил… и люди тоже.. Нет одна разница таки появилася, цени не сдерживают, ну вобщем, на самом деле, здесь нельзя упрекнуть, в етом  но бляха муха, тога признайте наконец што пожиточний минимум уже лет десять… не тисячу гривен… а тисяч п’ять гривен… можно вижить за 600грн в месяц и за 400грн в месяц, тоже, по себе знаю, но не болем чем вижить, давайте признаєм, што зарплата должна бить до 10 тисяч гривен…. При сложившейся ситуации штоб жить болем менее, ведь ето же так, далеко не тисяча…. Все начинається с признания… што ето так, после признания… нужно подумать как заробативать більше, такиє слова настояний заробіток, государства, находится не в производстве милиардов никому не нужной, кроме нас самих, да и самим за частую не нужних, заграницей покупаєм, едениц продукции, а в производстве, хоть и не більшого, пусть ето будет в 100раз менше, но дорогостоящей продукции, которая, востребована даже в європе, я и другиє люди согласни из информацией … то єсть зачеп строить 10 тисяч лад, к примеру… коториє никому не нада… купляют в украине от безисходности, а не от потребности… за те самиє деньги, можно построить 1 тисчу к примеру, електромобилей, и виручить, куда більше денег, чем ми проданим 10 тищ лад… Пора отходить от старого СССР когда лиш би зготовить, да так можно зарабативать, можно пока єсть тот, кто производит, штото болем низького качества… а качествениє аналоги європейських стран, ну уж очень дорогиє, все дело в автоматике, єсли украина построит завод, по производству оборудования,  для изготовления високого качества изделий…в украини єсть все шанси, стать поставщиком изделий у Європу… Из украинского експорта кто все скупаєт, как думаєте, процентов 70 росия скупаєт кроме некоторих галузей, ето я и имею в виду купит лиш тот в кого качество продукции еще ниже….     Люди їздили в Москву на заробітки завод пищевих продуктов, слой пили на оборудовании 20 сантиметров, люди сміються о какой блин санитарии может ити реч… не убиралося со времен СССР не иначе…. Я би порекомендовал господину Путину В.В. провести капитальную инспекцию, на фото какоє мне показали 20 см не било, хотя уверяли есть места где по 20 см пили, но из фото сделаного на заводе… видно шото 10-15мм єсть, а за три метра конвеєр с какой то єдий, и на нем єда… подобное сняли на фабрике конфет…. Блин я росийский ролтон никогда не ем не потому, даже, што он росийский, а лиш потому, што зная урівень санитарии, в многих предприятиях, побаююсь на ролтоне то же самоє, я боюся их єсть, хотя могу сєсть яблуно не обмивши… За скоко обирається 1 мм пили от 1 месяца до 6 месяцов… при 10-15 мм пили я смію предположить не убирали на производстве шоколада… 10месяцев-4 года, направте пожалуйста инспекции котрих нельзя купить, хотя таких не биваєт, создайтє, украинцам не ржать, ми сами не далеко от росиян в етом плане… пусть подимит руку тот кто убираєт завод по три раза в день или чаще, как у європе… а ето ведь стандарт, и ето входит в цену продукции.. Провожу аналогію один из заводов європи видео, парни говорять, они што издеваются аж блестит все, люди работают в халатах, балахонах и на каждих 3 робочих приставлена уборщица, не приведи бог где пилинка упадет… Украина дела по интереснее уборка раз в день, а иногда раз в три месяца… и ето чистая правда… думаєте Європа захочет куплять… купит тако один вид продуктов органик… из вирощених, те што без химии… Про росию єсть… уборки в некоторих и по 10 раз в день, єсть, но єсть и не ясно скоко лет не убирали… и не нада ржать… Вся проблема Украини даже в не желании делать качественно, все би хотіли продавать європе, проблема украини в том што в нас нет заводов, производящих оборудованиє для таких заводов, а купить європейскиє аналоги, дорого… Цена украинского 100тищ гривен то у європейського цена 300тисяч доларов, но на нем и заробатуют куда більше, щас об’ясню в чем суть… сирє, што на украинскоє што на європейскоє приходит одинаковой цени… одинаково… но європейскоє в 10 раз дороже, иногда покупают…. Носом чуєте разницу? Цена к примеру 10 грн сиря на 9 грн… и на оставшуся гривну зарплата, прибиль и так далеке, а куда ми цену, не можем поднять, куда ее поднимать по 10 гривен не очень то берут… А європейського качества по 100грн берут и 9 грн из них цена сиря… да я канешно преувеличил с разницей товара там дело не так кардинально всево лиш в 2-5 раз… но по сути то што указал виходит, в украине уто недочет… Што європа не купляла би продукцію надлежащего качества в украине, думаю ми би заменили половину их товаров продуктов питания, єслиб они сказали, да ми согласни, ваши продукти питания не хуже наших изготовлени.. замени ли би, а ето валюта, ето иностранная валюта… євро, долари и так далее, можно не токо уголь продавать…     Хотите роскажу, почему в украине не хотят вечной енергии… елемент перший нужна валюта, продаєм європе нефть газ уголь, в росии купляєм нефть газ уголь, казалось би а где заробіток вроде не где. Ето как в анегдоте о банкире, син спрашиваєт отца.. папа ти береш деньги в людей… отец беру… син отдаеш их людям.. отец отдаю… син я не вижу смисла… отец возьми в руки кусок масла.. син и ничево не понимаю… отец положи назад кусок масла… син и што всеравно не понимаю… отец руки жирниє? Син да жирниє… отец ну в етом и єсть смисл што беру даю кручу ими, а мне то процент и не плохой капаєт… Тоесть украина продала уголь нефть и газ за валюту Європе, свою продала, а в росии куплет так сказать по бартеру… украинскиє товари в росию, а нефть с росии, вот и все… с етого випливаєт… што могли би росии продукти за долари продавать, ну так виходит… если би создать так звание вечние енергии… и не факт што європе, не смогли продавать…      Ще людям ужасно понравится идея радиоприємника, точнєє фонарика, на радиоволнах… дело в том, што радиоприємник, принемаєт оноситєльно не велику потужність… 0.01-1ват… ел магн волн…. На колєбательний резонансний контур… если в колебательний контур, в опрєделеной точке, присоєденить лампочку, с ниткой розжаривания, как в светодиоде… она будет светить, токо в отличии от светодиода, така микролампочка, пропускаєт ток в обє сторони… длина нити 1-2мм товщини в микрони… то когда, в такой колєбатєльний контур, попадєт ел магнітна енергія, и заставит колебатся електрони… появится напряжениє и ток… то єсть некая мощность… наша лампочка имеет колосальне сопротивлениє нити… при очень малой толщинє и длинє, поетому, теоретично, здатна почати, світитися при току 0.01а і напрузі 0.05 вольт…. А цього на справді достатньо, щоб було досить тьмяне світло, колєбатєльний контур, має два типи настройки… перший через конденсатор, другий видвиганням і задвиганням феромагнітного стержня… налаштували на певну ел магн хвилю… якщо в городі, сто пудов усі куплять такі фонарики, вони без батарейок працюют, перетворюють, сигнали найближчих радіостанцій, в світло…   за селом, навіть де не має, сигналу радіостанцій, є так зване ел магн випромінювання стратосфери та іоносфери… бажано, такі приймачі… на нього розраховувати… тобто купили ліхтар… і забили, на те що він без батарейок… ввімкнули, замкнувши контур… поглина ел магн хвилі, лампочка світиться… і не треба, купляти батарейки, якщо перегорить лампочка, міняй… вигідно тим, що якщо ліхтар згас… два варіанта… вимкнули радіостанцію… налаштували на іншу радіостанцію, абож якщо й так лампочка не горить скоріше за всє лампочка накрилась, замінити… никакой вечной енергии… всє по законам физики, єсли нет природних волн, можно спиздить, у радиостанций, оплачивать, сет за електричество.. не тєм у кого фонарики, придєтся, а тем кто передаєт радіосигнали, на радиостанциях…  котушку контура делаєм ужасно малой индуктивности, а конденсатор ужасно огромной ємкости…. Причина, гроза… будет менше влиять на контур… а лампочка кушаєт от 0.001вата до 0.1 вата в час… нормикова идея роялті с неє от 10 центов до 1 долара… причина такого запроса, скоряє всєго, в мирє будут призводить, по 5 милиардов, таких штук в год… или даже більше… страни в каких будет на максимум применшено США а также континент африка… в США фермери… вокруг своїх ранчо сделают освещениє, такой фигней, штоб відеокамера, ночю, могла запечалить вора… в африке причина друга, нет такого распространєния електросєтей… Такиє фонари когут освещать, всє города європи… дачниє посєлки… а хули, включил, и не ображаєш на нуго внеманиє, пока нє потухнет…. А в теории он никогда не потухнет… и будет гореть вечно, если принимаєт волни солнца, отражониє от стратосфери, и при етом не сломаєтся…. Вечной енергии нет, єсть токо херни… напоминающиє єє… проблеми с освещениєм, дорог ночю… налепили вдоль догоги с двух сторон, через каждиє 5 метров, такиє фигни, и вуаля… осветили дорогу… в 1км дороги… 400 фонариков… по 10 центов, ето 40 доларов, дорог до 20 млн км такоє когут взять… ето 800млн доларов… а што не плохо… токо єсли их настроять на радиостанции, они начнут прозрєвать, они и так с етой фигнєй уже годами борятся, а тут єще и в масовом масштабє….      Подкажу, как спиздить електрику из електросєтей бєз проводов… вот люди пиздять електрику… протягивая кабеля, вдоль линий електропередач… их ловят…. Вичисляя где идет утечка…. В меня принцип тотже, но крам другой, берем штото на подоби спутниковой тарелки, на самом деле полу труба, котора принимаєт ел магн волни, и фокусуєт в какуюто линию…. На месте етой линии… ставим кабель, діаметра 6-10 см…. Ету тарелку, монтируєм на камаз вместе с етим кабелєм, с кабеля електрику, забираєм на акумулятори…. Подєхали камазом, к високовольтной линии електропередач…. Направили на ниє антену… ел магн волни сфокусировались ми их потрубили… до 100квт в час может сжирать камаз или більше… постояли намазом ночь… часов восєм, зарядили акумулятори, боліє того камаз можно передєлать на електроакумуляторах штоб єздил… внутр. Прицепа антена стоит накрита, штоб снаружи не било видно, подєхали в селе в ключили, установку, под. електролиниями… спиздили електрику, и пусть потом РЕС ищит, кто на провода штото накидаєт… боліє того… такой камаз может бить сразу со сваркой, а што приєхал под. високовольтну линию… акумулятори зарядил, сварил всє што нада… а РЕС хай еще найдет сначала каким образом, спиздили електрику… версія така… єсть посадка, в которой можно поставить камаз, под. линями ел передач, на камаз натягуєм маскировочну сєтку, штоб его нє видно био… и ктото на шухер стаєт… єсли видит што ктото начал проверять, вєбуєт по посадкє, намазом , да и дєлов…. Ага рес проєхал, там где бил камаз, провєряєт дальше, намазом назад подєхали… они провєрили… и не поймут гдє у них утєчка, будут потом каждий день провєрять….  Єсть єщє версія номер два…. Берем трактор… щелерез…. По полю, вдоль линии Електросистем… прорезаєм канал… ширини 5 см глубини 2 метра…. На дно канави, всажуєм провод, диамера 1см изолирований, длина провода пару км…. Хтото скажет рес догадається… ага нон є сразу на глубину 2 метра врядли додумаються ями копать…. Вспашка… не боліє чем на грубину 70 см долається ето сама кака нє єсть глибока… провод не перепашут….. да и провод не простой, а в кавичках «золотой» на самом дєлє, все просто… самого кабеля там 2мм вокруг, 4 сантиметрового наполнителя, што увеличуєт об’єм, то єсть, пластикова труба, обмотана фольгой…. И за изолирована… площадь сдоар огромезна…. Єще лутше, так можно зарить трубу діаметром 2 метра, длиной в 100 метров, ще догадайся, што ктото так сдєлал… или просто зарить стальну трубу в изоляции, и собирать єю електрику, с електросєтей… Лев они ведь сразу с металоискателем, начнут провода искать… а вот насчет камаза, ето да… попробуй догадайся… што в когото машина електрику воруєт, ето нада с поличним ловить…. Рес, пока металоискателем будет искать, машина уєдет.. но вот развє ГБДД не заметит, страну конструкцію, у камазє…. Арах насчет етого… в меня  єсть идея номер два… нафига нам возить антену, куда груз потом грузить…. Сделаєм лутше…. Критий фургон…. Сверху в доль всей будки фургона изолированиє провода, шлейфом уложениє, што в итогє, дає тих как би мини проводами, снимающими не більшу енергію с енергосистем, провода, товщини по 2мм, длини по 10метров… ширина камаза 2 метра… то єсть…по ширинє, будет… 90-95 проводов, єсли очень плотно, ефект от них, буде тчуть по ниже, чем у антени, раза в два… но при етом… хал явний сир, у мишеловкє никто не отмєнял… внешний корпус к примеру фури, сделан с тонкого пластика, провода, зало жени меж внешней и внутреней пластиной, внешнего корпуса фури… єсли фура стоит рядос из електросєтями, в проводах, наводится переменная ЕДС, с помощю електроники ми или преобразуєм, или на халяву, заряжаєм, акумулятори… к примеру, зимой так можно печку топить от акумуляторов, в машинє, и так далєєє… или к примеру сварка… другой вопрос, гбдд удивится, нахрена камазу штук п’ятдесят акумуляторов… а ответ елементарен… можно официально сделать, камаз на елєктроакумуляторах, и попитатся промолчать, каким образом, идет зарядка акумуляторов… официально, он будет їздить, от того, што заряжаєм дома, но ето будет… 5-10% от всій електрики каку потребит камаз, остачу спиздить…. Лев.. бляха в реса проблеми, начнут ловить таких умников… ти не заморочуй голову.. лутше вот єсли єсть способ по твоєму, сделать енергогенератор  котрий тратит к примеру 1квт, а виробативаєт 10 квт… от так єсли укажеш, способ, и учениє, согласятся, да теоретично ето так, украина тебе, ми подумаєм над етим, возможно от милиона, до десяти милионов доларов, за ето подарит… а вот єсли нє сможеш… прєкращай єрундой страдать…      Арах установка АФАЄР архив тайной служби КГБ, принципиальниє схеми, от НЛО как би получ єни, вобщем ви попали…  Орел как тебе ето дали… Арах я подобну фигню придумал, потом мнє показали што в архівах, похоже уже єсть, кстати в украинских, не вкурю што они не хотят єго вводить… Орел ну они же хотят нефть и газ продавать… а єсли етот как єго там… Арах АФАЄР,,, Орел єсли он работать будет там труба и нафти и газу и углю, как топливу.. для тец… ну нафига нада уголь, єсли ми тратим 1квт електрики, штоб получить к примеру 10 квт електрики… так же виходит?? Арах ви канєшно правильно описяли но АФАЄР теоретично может давати с 1 квт не 10 квт, а 1мват…  Орел ето брєд… енергія токо тєряєтся… закон сохранєния енергии… Арах к сожаленью, АФАЄР ето всєво лиш теплонасосная тец, забирающая тепло… и прєвращающая в електричєство…. Ток для виработки 1 мвт електроенергии… нада от 1до 10квт електроенергии… котора будєт забрана, из тепловой и прєвращеная в електричєство… тут просто будет факт… афаєр, замораживаєт, всє вокруг сєбя, ето правда… забирая тепло из земли, при етом, прєфращаєт в електрику, поетом, рядом с афаєром, даже летом, будет минус тридцять градусов… она используєт, так називаємую обратную теплопередачу, через термопари…. То єсть ми охлаждаєм, термопари… хотя обачно их нагрєвают…. Орел и как же ета хрень работаєт… Арах елементарно… знаєте што такоє термопара.. ето двухметалична пластина, или же полупроводникова пластина, єсли сквозь двуметаличну пластину, проходит тепло… то ета пластина способна поглощать часть тепла, в виде ЕДС образованой металами, плюс… потоков електронов, одна термопара с метала, прєобразуєт… 1-4% тепла в електроенергію…. Лев правильно нє спорю нон є більше 4% ну полупроводникова 10%... Арах не спорюю всє верно… до того момента, єсли я через діелектрик поставил в притул две таких пластини… Лев в теории вийдет што одна забрала 4% тепла поданого на неї, а друга, ще 4% уже від зменшеной тепло енергии тобто тепла пройде 96%*96%/100%=92.16%... я поняв што ти хочеш сказать, ти хочеш сказать, што ти их подряд поставиш тисячу, и будеш нагрєвать… ну звини братуха, тут максимум, што ти доб’єшся, што в видє… електрики ти собєреш 99.99% тепла… ето вєдь нє 100%... Орел походу таки нафти и газу, жопа… а тепловой насос подаєт 5-25 квт тепла, за счєт 1квт електрики… єсли пересчитать… 25квт*0.99=24 квт грубо говоря, даже при кпд прєобразования…. Етой енергии 10% вийдет вечний двигатель без вечного двигателя… но кпд преобразования будет процентов 40…. То єсть с 1 квт електро в теории до 10 квт тепло… стоп ти говорил в теории до 1 мвт… не што ето уже возможна комбинация тец, ето ясно… но как может бить с 1квт електрики, 1мвт електрики єсли 2-3 квт гарантия вийдет и до 10 квт… Арах во во ето єсли нагрєвать тепловим насосом термопари… допустим ми создали, термопару 99.99% забирающу тепла в електрику… Лев ну допустим и так ну хай уже 2-3 квт из 1 квт получим, но блядь, не 1 мвт…. Ми ведь нагрєваєм термопари.. Арах проблема в том, што ми тепловим насосом, охлаждаєм термопари… ми их охлаждаєм, к примеру до -60 градусов цельсия…. Закон сохранєния енергии гласит… в своєм витокє, тепло… может передаватся об’єктам… а вот холод не может перєдаватся об’єктам… Цикало а как же тога холодильник, ми вєдь холод им перєдаєм…. Кошка хи хи хи ушиб мои етого не слишали, даже собака, лапами морду закрила, и рот от того што холод передається… да никогда он не передається…. Єсли по народном… боліє холодний об’єкт, поглощаєт тепло, из боліє нагрітого об’єкта… за сет того што он меннє нагрітий, просто в народє вякают… холод передається… на самом делє… тепло передається в физикє, єсть тепло… енергія, интиресно би увидєть, холодову енергію…. Температура виражаєт ступень нагрєтости тела… нет такого понятия как холод, єсть замораживать, температура в цельсия кельвіна фарангейта… а вот щоб була холодова енергія немає… бо що тоді виходить… в нас є один кг одного матеріалу з -273 градуса хтось скаже абсолютна холодова енергія… і є 1 кг 273 градуса цельсія… ми перемішали стало нуль градусів цельсїя, але водночас з цим 0 градусів цельсія стало… що в кельвінах 273 градуса…. Тобто, якби була холодова енергія… то -273 градуси додали +273 градуси енергія рівна стала нулю… але вибачаюся… температура змінилася, але кількість теплової енергіі осталась та сама, отже холод це не вид енергіі а це фізичне поняття якє описує, що холодний об’єкт, має менше теплової енергії… ось і все, а при перемішуванні більш холодного з теплішим… відбудеться передача тепла, від нагрітого до холодного… ось і все… Лев к чему такиє дебати, от кошки… Арах к тому што холодовой енергии априори, не существуєт, єсть токо тепловая… и єсли ми, забираєм тепловую енергію, из ядра АФАЕР, ето значит ядро стаєт способним, поглощать тепловую енергію…. Тожсть, окружающа середа, начинаєт отдавать своє тепло, охлаждєном ядру… а как ми свами уже уславились, термопари забирают в теории 99.99%... то єсть до ядра дойдет лиш 0.01% от тепла… одним киловатом, електрики… с ядра ми забрали… 10квт тепла…. В итогє виходит што 10квт етого тепла, ето 0.0001 от всєго тепла, пошедшего на АФАЄР… то єсть єсли 1квт електрики… забрал 10квт тепла с ядра… а термопари… пропустили 0.01% от всєго тепла, а остачу перевєли в електрику… теоретично, це означа, що АФАЕР, за рахунок 1квт використаної електроенергії, поглинає з грунту… 100мвт електроенергіїїїї, якщо кпд, хочаб 10% установки…. То з 1квт електроенергії, буде отримано 10мегават електроенергії, але це не вічний двигун, а установка, по перетворенню, теплоенергії, в електроенергію, всі закони фізики, соблюдені… як зроблені термопари… це двох металічні пластини… наприклад із срібла плюс літію…. Товщина термопари..менше одного мікрометра… сопротивлениє струму, минимальноє, так как термопара охлаждаєтся, то єсть в 1мм термопарного чипа, по толщине, может бить, до 1 тисячи термопар.. но изза того што ми термопари, изолируєм, друг от друга, діелектриком, их будєт от 100 до 500 в 1мм, товщина стенки АФАЄР из термопар… до 1метра… то єсть количєство термопар при толщинє 1мм от 100 штук подряд из кпд 2-3% кажда… виходи из каждой термопари отдельниє… общє кпд забора тепла в електрику 50-80%, у такой тонкой микроной термопари… микро енергии нада собирать или с помощу, мікросхем…. Подали енергію, на транзистор, подали сигнал, прєвратили в переменний ток, собрали микронапряжения в большее кпд такого процеса до 40%, слишком малиє напряжения… или же… заряжать от термопар много, низьковольтних акумуляторов, к примеру по 0.01-0.1 вольт напряженим… зарядили акумулятор, дальше такиє акумулятори включаєм послєдовательно… кпд етого процеса 30-;) 40% то єсть с 1 квт ел енергии с ядра крадем 10 квт тепла… ети 10 квт тепла, являються половиной тепла, котороє отдаєт земля… єще 10 квт тепла превращаєтся в микроенергии… собираєм их с кпд 40%.... получаєм 4 квт електро енергии… и виходит как в сказкє, потратили 1 квт електроенергии.. получили 10 квт теплоенергии, для опалення, а сверху, получили 4 квт електроенергии… один киловат идет на зацикливаниє, а 2.5 квт идет на другиє потребитєли… и вечного движка нет, и енергія на халяву… о продавци угля нефти и газа, охренєют…     Орел вобще фигеетє, а настояний єсть, етот ясно што может работать, меня настояний вечний движок интєрєсуєт… Арах и таке добро имєєтся… Лев слушай ти би ети идеи прислал к нам в администрацию президента украини… Арах прислал, отослали назад, и вєжливо послали за гори срать… єсли перву часть, мармизонского балєта, не отправили назад, втору сказали, такиє фантазии, нє интєрєсуют… Орел не отвлекайся всєх вечна енергія интєресуєт…. Арах вариант номер один…. Качель вічної енергії….. теорія, якщо створити качель, котра за звичай, знаходиться в стані рівноваги…. З немагнітящогося матеріалу… на одному з країв, прикріпляємо ротор, точніше якорь, котрий при прокручуванні на 180 градусів, повністю міняє полюс…. Дану качель, розміщуємо, над надзвичайно великим магнітом, оскільки, у всій нашій конструкції, з магнітом взаємодіє лише ротор…. То, коли він повернений полюсом щоб притягувався, він притягується, коли повернений щоб відштовхувався, відштовхується….. теоретично…. Це так… плече качелі… 500метрів, висота пробігу… магніту 200метрів від нижньої точки до верхньої… магніт знаходиться під качеллю…. Він надзвичайно великий… діє закон подібний до закону тяжіння, сила взаємодії прямо пропорційна масі і обернено пропорційна квадрату віддалі між ними… тобто…. Є великий і малий магніт… вони взаємодіють, оскілки… сила взаємодії досить мала качель, гравітаційно, повинна бути урівноважена… далі відбувається, як в казкі… в верхній точці, сила взаємодії пропорція маса розділена на квадрат відалі… в нижній так само…., в верхній точці, фактично не витрачаєм енергі. На провертання, він фактично сам провернеться… а ось в нижній точці.. тратим енергію….. сила взаємодії коеф*м1*м2/відстань в квадр…. Схожа ситуація з магнітами…. Фм1*Фм2*коеф/відстань в квадраті…… припустімо, нижня точка, на відстані 800меирів, над магнітом, а верхня точка, на відстані 1000метрів над магнітом… сила взаємодії, мін=Ф1*Ф2*коеф/1млн… макс=Ф1*Ф2*коеф/640 тисяч… знаходимо різницю сили…. 1млн/640 тисяч=1.8 раз приблизно….. тобто в нижній точці сила взаємодії в два раза більша, чим в верхній… тобто багн взаємодія в горі в два раза більше, чим в низу… припустімо теоретично що в верхній точці…. Сила взаємодії прирівнюється до 1 тони… тоді в нижній точці до 2 тон… між постійними магнітами… енергія виробляємо взаємодією приблизно 60%* 1 тону*відстань… що виходить.. видаваєма системою енергія 200м*1т*0.6=120тон*м умовно… а ось якщо ротор має діаметр 0.2 метра… проте дуже довгий, для його провертання в обох точках буде потрачено.. до 2тон на метр… а решта 115 тон на метр… наша вигода…. Кпд наприклад відсотків 50% перетворене в електрику.. ротор прокручуємо, червячним редуктором…. Хтось скаже тон на метр… бред вибачаюся електрики тона переведуть в нютони…. 1150 н на метр умовно з них 50% не більше в електрику вдасться… для порівняння ел двигун 7.5 квт, сила тяги 108н на метр.. частота, 50 обертів за секунду…діаметр ротора 40см… зрозуміло… чи не так … тобто така система матиме теоретично, видачу енергіі постійно, але вона буде досить малою, її усилити, можна лише, шляхом збільшення кількості роторів… теорія елементарна… якщо діаметр, ротора зменшувати, але магн властивості збільшенням його довжини, то теоретично.. це нагадуватиме маленький магніт та огромний магніт, по факту, так і буде. Якщо діаметр мінімум то і робота, на прокручування буде мінімум… дивіться магнітна сила, не змінилася.. а ось плече сили, зменшилося… якщо в ел магн двигуну, це нічого не дасть, тут теоретично, може дати… тут..     Орел слишал казку как черепаха зайца наєбала… прєдставим заяц, рєшил взять реванш, но решил от черепахи, ни на шаг, нє отбєгать… Арах но он нє знал, што черепаха, искусний мєханик, и прєвратила, свій панцир, в автомобіль… когда єй нада, колеса видвигаются спереди и ззади, она достаєт шлєм на голову, достаєт руль, прикрепляєт спереди… передними лапами рулюєт, а задними жмєт на тормоз и газ…. Орел и вот вишли черепаха с зайцем на старт.. заяц говорит єй, я от тєбя ни на шаг нє отойду… черепаха в отвєт, нє волнуйся зайчик, ти будєш пиль глотать… Арах ну вот стоят всє звєри, и черепаха начала на стартє, из панцера руль доставать и шлєм, гидравлика, начала с панцира видвигать передниє колєса, увязаниє с рулєм, и задний мост.. ув’язаний с двигателем… черепаха, запустила… двигатєль, поставила руль, одєла шлєм, взялася лапами за руль…. И заяц єє спрашуєт а ето што єщє, чєрєпаха  а ето моє собственоє срєдство передвижения, котороє всєгда со мной,  заяц оно тєбє не поможет Орел и вот они двинулися со старта… заяц сразу же получил столб пили в лицо… черепаха, полєтєла как формула 1, со скоростью 420 км в час… куда тому бєдному зайцу при єго 50 км в час, за нєй угнатся….  Черепаха, уже час как на финише… прибегаєт заєц…. Слиш черепаха, когда у зверей спрашивал нє видели тєбя, сказали што черепаху, нє видєли, зато видели нєизвєсний єздящий об’єкт, напоминающий черепаху….. и снова ти мєня наєбала, доказав што умєниє думать, способно компенсировать, недостатки физичєских парамєтров…     Лев тупая сказка… говорил єсть щє «вечний движок» валяй…. Арах «вечний двигатєль» с нло захваленого 2003 году ФАЄТОН.. нє важно кєм, виділ ескізи…   суть, вечного двигатєля…. Ставим, гигантский кольцевой магнит…. Внутр…. ставим, сбалансирований ротор, диамєтра 12 метров нє менше… в роторє, по краях, магнитниє якори, напоминающиє… довольно тонкиє стержни…. Когда ми проварачиваєм, тонкиє якоря, в роторє, угол отклонєния, магнітного поля, меняєтся… якоря, ето стержни діаметра 1см… они крутяться, и взаимодействуют, из диском, сила взаимодействия, пряморопорциональна, магнитном действию, якорем умноженоє, на магн силу, внєшнєго диска… при етом, очєнь важний момент… кольцевой диск, должен бить, нєвєроятно сильним, по магнитной силє, к примєру диск, внутр. Диамєтр, 12метров, товщина 20 метров, внєшний диамєтр 30 метров,  фишка такого магната, очень глупая, сверхмощноє магнитноє полє, котороє, может втянуть, в себя, даже автомобіль… такоє, на самом дєлє и у генератора енергии с нло… рядом с краєм ротора, якори… товщини 1 см… фишка в чем, меж якорем и кольцом, возникаєт, магнитноє взаимодействиє, некая магнитная сила,  она оказиваєт сопротивлениє, проварачиванию, тонкого стержня… но изза сверх малого диамєтра… нада очень мало енергии щоб провертать… а вот, в свою очередь… образований етим магн момент, и крутной момент зависит от угла отклонєния, магн поля… по скоку діаметр… круга 12 метров, длина окружности, котору проходит якорь, за счєт проварачивания, на 360 градусов, равна 40 метров… при етом ми енергиююю тратим на преодолениє, всего лиш… 3.15*0.5=1.7см…. раз ница длини… 200раз…. Єсли косинус угла отклонєния рамен 0.3-0.7… тога енергія макс виработана систємой равна 200*0.3=60 раз теоретично прєвисит, енергію нужну для пуска установки… то єсть…  даже при превишении виработаной енергии на 10% от потраченой… уже будет вечний движок… ето может работать, а может и нєт, я нє знаю, ето не АФАЄР в котрого всє закони физики соблюдени, и нет понятиє вечной енергии… а токо прєобразованиє тепловой в електро…    Лев твои теории учениє розобют в пух и прах… Арах уви они не имеют права… дело в том што ето научнофантастичноє- літературне произведениє.. участвуют научниє идєи, научно-фантастичниє, и фантастичниє, ни один учений мира нє в правє, опровєргать тєории…. Орел скажут што нє правда тєории… Арах хм сам жанр говорит што тєории придумани… и когут нє нести нє каких научних оснований, тєории нєльзя, опровергать но их можно подтвєрждать, ужасно хитрая система, нельзя опровергнуть идеии но можно подтвєрдить… Лев да ну нафиг, можно опровєргнуть, пишется научноє опровєржениє… на идеии в твоєм написаном сочинєнии…. Арах а вєдь люди нє дураки, єсли начнут опровєргать, научну фантастику, они догадаються, раз єє питаються опровєргнуть, значит там єсть рєальниє технологи, коториє питаються скрить…. Дєло в том, што научна фантастика, визначально пишется в стилє теоретично возможной науки+теоретично не можливой… а ось якщо хтось намагається, спростувати…. Це може означати лише одне, він спростовує лише тому, що сам допускає, що таке можливо буде працювати, я такого порядку затрамбоню, інтелектуальну петлю, щоб не согли його спростувати, хоч боком, хоч раком, хоч задом… Лев всєравно спростуєм твои идеии…    Арах єслиби академии наук страдали, опровєржениєм сказок и научной фантастики… повертє, психіатри сами би их забирали лечится в дурку… токо больной на голову человек, способєн начать, питатся опровергнуть, научно фантастичниє идеи.. из научной фантастики… што само собой подразумєваєт, што могло бить видумано, штоугодно и как угодно… и токо психически больной человек, начнет питатся опровєргать, идеии научно фантастичного характєра… даже єсли єсть желаниє опровєргнуть… зная што они работают… нє совєтуююю не позортєсь, ета сказка, мультиранга, не каждий єє видержит, психічно… поскоку, ета сказка, ето как, проверка на вшивость, гос структур….  Сам по сєбє стиль, научна фантастика, подразумєваєт, што там пишется всяка научна нисенитница…. А вот люба попитка несенитнициу опровергнуть может бить прочитана так не нісенітниця- тобто правда, не питайтеся, уважає миє опровєргать… Лев ми тебя сами, начнем ганять, за то што нє даєш нам, на нафти газє и углє, ти хоть понимаєш, изза твоєй гад ости, может начать падать мировая цена, на енергоресурси… Арах блят…. Хорошо єсли начнєт падать…. Ато 800 доларов, пошти за 1000кубов газа… для населения при зарплатє в 80-120 доларов в мєсяц, ето както нє по пацански… нє смотритє 7 грн 1 кубометр газа…. Хай щас курс ближе к двацати…. Но я єще нє разу нє видел чуда такого в украини…  штоб єсли впала цена в поставщика, то продавци нє любот снижать… и будєт долар по 3 грн… попитаються газ по 7 грн за кубометр оставить… хотя при том курсу он должен бить 1-2 гривна максимум… єсли ктото, с политиков, нє догадался… ета сказочка, про бабку пара сочку… начнєт приводить к  усилєнию гривни, єсли украина додумається, подтвердить, типа хтото, слил инфу, єсли нє додумається, в меня ощущениє, может сєсть пару десятков чиновников, за потєрю государствених тайн, єсли тот отдєл от СБУ котрий у мєня брал идеи, начнєт мозги єбать, сяде топа чиновником… они меня попросили, тараканов, повикуривать, в украинской политикє…. Лев намєкаєш што ти агент нац. Безпеки… Арах нет? я тот? кто в своє врємя их задовбал.. тепер они попросили, задовбать политиков… штоб жизнь медом не казалася… цікаво виходить, головне управління СБУ, має обмежений доступ, до таємної інформації колишньой служби кгб… попроси їх пустяк знайти не можуть, я думав, що ті з ким зв’язаний, брешуть, що не можуть знайти цю дрібницю, але її і головне управління сбу не знайшло… цікаво не знайшли тому що в них нема доступа, чи тому що інформація, вже видалена, чи тому, що інформацію, не подали, в загальнодержавний реєстр, таємной служби КГБ… цікаво… але ж повині, бути причини чому СБУ не змогли найти…. Лев… слиш кого могут они попросить.. ти кто…     Арах мой клас ИНТЕЛЕКТУАЛЬНИЙ ХАКЕР, єсли я прощитаю, как можно интєлектуально, взломать систему, я могу ето попробивать…. Ето как хакер, для компютеров, токо интєлектуальний хакер нужен для виноса мозга… иними словами загрузить… кстати, в даной сказкє, што указано… сбу нє может опровєргать, они имеют право, токо подтверждать… они когут сказать, што у них нє числится… нон є имєют права говорить што в сказкє наврал как троцкий… поскоку, сказка сама по сєбє, означає… што сказка лож, но в нєй намєк… токо вопрос на што намєк… пусть голову ламают… Лев да ну нафиг… Арах стишок… сказка лож.. Казка лож, да в нєй намок, Не угроза, но упрєк, Видит ясно наш народ,  Гдє подсказка, гдє упрєк, Видит ясно, наш народ, Што же дєлать не поймєт. У когото хата скраю,  У когото поперек, Шевельнулася страна, Била скраю, в центр ушла, Стала жизнь в нас попєрєк, И народ наш не поймет,  И рамси нє собєрет, Што же дєлать, не поймєт,  Видит жопу, видит рот, Сказка лож, да в ней намек, Нє угроза, но упрєк,  Сказка лож, но в ней намек,  Што нам дєлать, как нам жить,  Как родну страну развить..  Орел плохой стишок, мнє нє нравится… Лев довидєливаєшся…     Арах вам класно казать кварплату подняли, до 3-5 тисяч грн. в месяц… даже из субсидеєй в 50-75%, єє нереально заплатить, обичном человєку, так рєбята, майдановци, походу политики, уже забили, што такоє майдан… при зарплатє, в 1 тисячу гривен… не хватит зарплати, даже из субсидиєй… дальше долг, дальше через, суд ваши квартири за копейки продадуть, своїм же, в счет погашения долга, после чего продадуть, квартири дорого… в вас квартири, по 5 тисяч грн. заберут… а продадуть… по 50 тисяч… или ви рєбята, послє майдана, розучились, открито говорить, а сєчас, токо дома на кухнє, вечером, гаразди, ето обсуждать… почему, наш парламент, после прєдваритєльного повишения цен на газ… в конце концов, зафигачил на посную, повишениє цен… мнє как начали об’яснять из жека… у вас кварплата 400 гривен, в том году била 200 грн, а с мая будет 3тисячи грн….. я прикинул… 3 тисячи поделил на 400 в 7.5 раз сразу…. Даже увеличения курса долара в полтора раза… нє об’ясняєш… потому што цена виросла в четире раза… но люди украини… подскажу плотят… 30% от стоимости не менше… єсли для производства електрика стоила 1.1 грн, то сечас ставят для людей… 2.5 грн 1 квт ел енергии будет стоит… што в полтора два раза прєвишаєт, економічно обґрунтований… для виробництв, котрим не має жодної знижки… що виходить люди, будуть платить, в два раза більше, а ніж, економічно необхідно, якось так виходе, тобто будуть не просто, платити, повну вартість, а ще й помножену на два…. Ось наприклад, на виробництві… де я парюся 1.2 грн за кВт, повна стоимость… а ось, до дому об’ясняли… по 2.5грн за киловат… што в нас государство, людей, за повних вибілів, держе???

Што дєлать…. На каждий вопрос второго цикла видається право одного голоса… но тут єсть но человека три варианта за, против, удержался, и как вариант отвєта принимаєтся гдє стоит галочка… и чеоловек может в началє цикла поставить галочку за, потом помєнять на против вобщем важно гдє стоит галочка, на самий послєдний день голосования.. к примеру в 12 часов дня… заполнєниє ответи отбираются систємой и щитаются голоса… на слєдущий день в 12 часов на голосова ниє, виставляється новий цикл вопросов, в том числє, тє по котрих уже голосували в етом году… и к примєру… єсли в прошлом году, за проголосували 90% то политикам, рєкомєндуют его виполнить… он может бить снят из голосования в етом году, токо в случає єго виполнєния… ету идею, я рекомендую всєм странам мира намет интернет голосования, людей по законам, естония уже штото подобне имєєт… Лев зачем ти меня ганиш…    Арах  ну из постоялих розговоров с Мишневим А.К. я сдєлал вивод што ви вобщем, положитєльний тип, а вот изза того што к вам, вобще нє реально пробится, и через знакомих пробивал, по барабану… нє єсть вариант, взять стариє документи,  КГБ из планами верховной ради, и администрации, и устромить шумок, штоб вас через запасной виход вивєли, а там встрєтить и отдать, токо зачєм, єсли вам можно и бєз етого в видє сказки отдать… нафига лишниє приколи… лутше уже казочкой… нє я могу вам об’яснить, как можно сдєлать так штоб вивєли…. Какраз в лапи… просьба вас, об’яснить, откуда Мишнєв А.К. знал што ви станєтє президентом, у вас же тоді, навіть думок про це не було… от цікаво.. ще одне цікаво в його заповіті була його родина і я.. більш нікого, він мені заповідав 4 власних книги, я їх університету подарував, хтось намікав, що я щось на кшталт правопрєємника, але не зовсім поняв, в якому сенсі… нє він з мене взяв обіцянку, частково продовжити його справу.. він правда навчав лише один рік, а потім помер.. нє я пойму, єсли ви назвете мене козлярою, козел, він і в африці козел, да я козел ще той… вибачайте, жодна людина, здатна до політики, не може не мати рис «козла», таким не місце в політикі, такі без рис козла, навіть не здатні до політичних ініціатив…. Лев а по нормальном нельзя, ну чесне слово…    Арах ви би знали, скоко вариантов, к вам досучаться я перєпробувал, ви би обалдєли, вариантов из 30… всє нє удачно, а вот етот вариант, ну уж повертє, пробст всє мури, государствєной машини… бил перший вариант, отправлял письмо из просьбой передать вам што с вами хотєл поговорить останій учень Мішньова А.К., бил вариант просто отправлял просьбу об аудиєнции, бил вариант через приближених к вам политиков, и так даліє… в отличиє, от срєднестатистичного человека, я знаю, как своїми идєями просочится, даже через желєзобєтоную, політичну стєну, но тут уже, я злой, от того, што заставили так дєлать, и принципиально, я в нєй проламаю, отвєрстиє, штоб она рухнула, в политику, не годяться, тє, кто нє умєют, туда пробиватся, політика, ето нє та галузь, в которой вайли вафнівські, здатні участвовать, я єє тєрпеть не могу, но ето нє означає, што я к ней нє способєн, повєртє, чуток научен, могу такого на творить, што будєш просто, прозрєвать… думаю даже мои родниє офигєют, от того што я на таке способєн, навєрно, они даже нє подозрєвали, а я учился етой фигнє, годами…  питался скрить штоб нє знали о політичних трєнировках, и прочем прочем… о трєнєровках придумивать тєхнику, тоже нє ставил в извєсность, ето бил мой секрет и наших придурков… уз Нимезид Украина, бившей тайной служби КГБ, собравшей всяких придурков, отсветившихся у кгб,   в идє назвонивания.. им на постоє, да так штоб и КГБ вешалися.. когда меня спросять я буду все отрицать, скажу всє сам видумал… так нада… єсли што, я сам всє придумал… а повєритє ли, ето иной вопрос…    Лев пипец ти чуш несеш… Арах ето хорошо што ви так считаєтє, етото инт удар ужасно хитрий, ето интєлєктуальний вирус, сначала с него должни начать люди ржать, и ето станєт причиной єго роспространєния, потом єго должни начать осуждать, а потом тє кто осуждаєт, начнут пиздюлєй получать, от тєх, кто поймет, што в етом интєлєктуальном, вирує заложено… Лев о чем ти.. Арах етап перший трудно распространить то, што всє люди нє мечтают почитать, то єсть сказка, должна бить меч той, каждого, кто хочет поржать, ето будєт виполнєно, второє, сказка, должна визвать, желаниє во многих, говорить што так нєльзя, и так даліє, вобщем осуждать… што подимєт єє на максимальноє обсуждєниє, думаю виполнєно, и трєтьє, когда логічно думающиє люди догонят, што за информация, вложена в ету сказку,  и какого порядка идєии заложини, проявится такоє понятиє, как 80-90% людей многиє идеи понравятся… то єсть суть в том, штоб донести до насєления мира, возможну комбинацию «вечних енергій», тут в п’ятку даже Франция уйдет, они вообще такиє идеии запрєтили… придєтся… им чучуть, перєсмотрєть, своє рєшениє о запрєтє… Лев а почему нормальним способом нє роспространить…     Арах нормальним способом, подсчитали нада около 200милиардов доларов, ви профинансируєтє??? Иними словами, ета сказка, виполнєт роботу, котору когут сдєлать, 200милиардов доларов, иними словами она их економит… приводя чутли нє к лихорадочном, распространєнию идей, после чего, начнут роздуплятся, што тут заложено… Лев а ми с орлом зачеп в сказкє… Арах ето «ракєтноє томливо» для сказки упоминаниє путина и порошенка, позволят, очень бистро распространится… сказкє, многиє сочтут ето смішним…  люди нє подвержениє масонству или к примеру вислим материям, нє сразу вруняться в суть сказки, им придєтся об’яснять, они увидять токо то што в строках написано… а вот второй смисл, заложений в строках, может понять лиш тот, кто нє может понять мислей внутр. Казки, будєт токо ржать как лошадь… ну да ладно што народу нада, штоб бил спокійним, хліба и зрелищ, тут им и интєлєктуальний хліб и интєлєктуальниє зрєлища… єсли нє ошибаюся ето чутли нє перший в мирє интєлєктуальний вирус… троянського типа… сверху казочка и смех, но с заложеним голубиним смислом в нєй.. ну што в украинє, может распространится бистрєє, чем история, похожая на анєгдот с участиєм Путина и Порошенка…. В других комбинациях, ета история будет ну очень медленно распростронятся, как коє кто говорил врємя ето дєньги… так нада врємя сводить до минимума..     Єще можно к примеру сделать собственний голивуд… задача государства, поспособствовать, создав киностудию, не хуже, єсли нада, я могу лично, накатать такой сценарий, голивуд отдихаєт, нервно куря в сторонке… такоє могу сочинить, што фиг придумаєш, даже в голову, не прийдет… такую казочку можно накатать, што єсли єє екранировать… волоси дибом во многих станут…. А почему нет, снимать будет сложно… В нас много людей способни к дизайнерству и актерском майстерству… К примеру голубой огонек, ну што ето за огонек…. Они не зажигают на новий год, как по мне… нада сделать єво чутли не балом маскарадом, смешаниєм стилів различних епох… к примеру допустим, Королева, в стиле 10тищ лет до нашей ери, Тарзан тоже, тесть меховая одежда, в доисторичном стиле, думаю им подойдет… Пугачова, Галкин и Киркоров в стиле  17-18 веков…етот стил какраз для етой троици… Пугачева в шикарнейшом платає с кружевами, и коториє позолоченими нитками вишити, вокруг шеии длинний, ворітник… но при етом спереди розрез… в одежде, как в сексуальних стилях платьєв, на руках платне не много в рюшках, и на рюшках хрустальниє кумушки… вобщем в стиле королей… Галкин одет в елегантний фрак, стиля 18 века из длинним циліндром, на голове… циліндр ето такой головной убор… киркорову більше подойдет… одежда как вам сказать как в короля из фильма три мушкетера… Алине Гросу думаю ем нада вийти в том стиле што она снимаєт свои самиє сексуальниє клипи, будет на раз всех охмурять.. Тине Кароль, думаю подойдет на новогодний огонек ее одежда из клипа де цвай май хат децвай май хат инеа децвай вайхат децвай децвай ай гейм.. Руслане дикие танци и ни што иноє… Вобщем по сути многим стоит на огонек одеть наряди из собственних клипов на самом деле, когда они в них снималии они ето долали от души… насчет Пугачевой думаю тот стиль, што я предлагаю єй нравится…. Некоторим подошол би стиль служанок королей, токо не в обиду, будет сказано… пажи и так далее гусари там всякиє монгольскиє хани, тевтонскиє рицари и так далее врубайте фантазию, а то огонек, напоминаєт каждий год, пластинку которая всегда одно и тоже крутит, и никакого контраста… освещение на голубом огоньке, немножко притемнить… к примеру сделать голубуватого цвета, ведь голубой же огонек… плюс сделать штото на подоби светомузики, различние круги, коториє візуально игратся, питаються с присутствующими, к примеру в сценарии сценка будто Пугачева питається впоймать… «зайчика» на столе светящуюся точку…  Сценка Пугачева пєт елегантно вино с бокала, и вдруг, якоби случаймо, замечаєт светящуюся точку, питающуся поиграть, с єє второй рукой, и говорит ех би єє поймать… Допиваєт вино с бокала, и питається поймать, и якоби ее таки впоймала, и візуальний ефект нада снять, будто ета светящаяся точка, так сильно питається вирватся из под. бокала, што в конце концов, розбиваєт єго и улетаєт прочь…  Киркоров также не скучаєт, роздобил гдето советскую газету, старого образца, и коментируєт, мол смотри как ранше жили и то и другое, при етом,єму постоянно мелькаєт светящаяся точка, и в конце концов, он начинаєт злится, скручиваєт газету в трубочку, и питається єю прибить светящуююся точку, но не попадаєт, и она улетаєт… Сечас голубой огонек… самая обичная корпоративна вечоринка… не болеє того… Но на самом деле ето должна бить новогодняя сказка, где будут и разниє анимированиє звери, и феи и прочиє сказочниє персонажи… ето должна бить настоящая новогодняя сказка, из хорошими песнями, штоб не токо взрослим, било інтересно, на ето смотреть….      Ладно вернемся к обиденном, скушном и прєсном… Што нада сделать в украине первим… ето 70% налогов оставить там, где их виплатили…. 30% в общий котел…. Как говорится… Што нада сделать с деньгами… на местах по возможности создать банки… видающиє в кредит оборудованиє, а так все как обачно… Главноє правило, котороє должно бить в стране, забудте о дотации одной галузи за счет других галузей, да вздраствуєт улутшениє производства… што ето значит, не нада погашать… постоянно убиточним производствам, постоянно ихниее убитки, нужно им помоч стать прибильними… Што ето вообще значит допустим производство тратит 150 тищ а продаєт на 100тищ, нужно такоє производство проанализировать от первого до последнего звена, и єсли не видно, как єво сделать прибильним, может стоить поставить новоє прибильноє, то на то на самом деле и вийдет, вот допустим… оборудованиє новоє стоит 300тисяч…. А на ремонт старого тратим 70 тисяч в год… нафига самих себя мучить нада создавать государственний векторний поток ресурса, котрий будет заменять староє изношеноє оборудованиє, а так же добавлять новоє оборудованиє, государство, должно дать обещаниє людям, и зафиксировать єго документально, постановою парламента, с подписю президента украини, и начать єво виполнять, што они не станут латать старие дири в госс предприятиях, как обично, а начнут делать новиє качествениє заводи, на какиє перейдут робочиє, или заменят староє оборудованиє новим… ну куда ето годится токарю 23 года а работаєт на станку котрому 53 года ппц, или токарю 56 лет а станку 76лет, во биваєт, о какой ефективности производства можно казать, и ето ми мол чим о украинской авиациии летающей на допотопних само летах, надеюся джипиес уже во всех стоит?     Вобщем што украине надо, собратся людям, и сочинить сказку, в какой стране, они би хотіли жить, а потом подумать как сказку, воплотить в жизнь… Вобщем то спасениє утопаючих, дело рук самих утопаючих, и єсли народ не захочєт, штоб в украине ситуація помінялась… самим политикам, це не з під руки… Що виходить, стать з нагайкой і контролировать, да може й так… якщо ще раз майдан випросять… Лев пипец у тебя шиза поїхала, що особливим себе, возомнив? Арах нет я просто человек котрий патріот своєй страни, как мне сказала психолог, ти слишком много о обще народном благе беспокоишся… Лев не понял… Арах штоб мне постоянко не парится, как сделать в украине лутше, нада об етом видать книгу… Лев чего ти лезеш не в своє дело…     Орел не єсли человек считаєт, што ето єго дело, почему би нет… Лев політика не для простих людей, а умних…. Арах знач я по вашому дурак? Лев наверно точно дурак… Арах хорошо, я дурак признаю, но то што я дурак еще не означає, што я тормоз-комунизма-антигравитационий-деструицирований-асонтрицеирований-камазовский… Лев чего чего… Цикало перший раз некоториє слова слишу… Арах слишали иногда о людях, говорять ни ума ни фантазии, так вот весь смисл, в том што інтелект человека=ум+фантазія…. Лев ну фантазер ти, аз из ушей прет… Арах а ето по вашим же словам, означає што інтелектуал… інтелект ум+фантазія  чем више інтелект… тем більше ума или фантазиии, или и то и другоє, не ток ли… Лев слушай, не загибай високиє материи, они не для обичних людей… Арах значит ви считаєте што обичниє люди тупиє? Лев я етого не говорил, сам сказал…. Ем поправочка обичниє люди бедниє, и им нада заниматся своїм благосостояниєм, а не всякой єрундой, типа политики, пусть думают как прокормить детей, а не о политике..     Арах то єсть жить по принципу мой дом, стоит на краю, и я нифига, не знаю? Лев слушай ти знаєш скоко за один день, таких как ти, администрация президента отфутболиваєт, тисячи… Арах ви мнє новость не сказали, ето знают все, кто питался, продвинуть идеи в администрацию президента… Лев тут парень понимаєш в чем дело… даже осли би ми принимали все ваши идеии, результат би тот же бил… Орел што денег би не хватило?    Лев ну за год милионов 10 идей пришло, представ себе, как их все, можно профинансировать, даже єсли дам добро… Арах все начинається с малого розобратся где хорошиє идеии.. Лев слушай умник, давай ви сядете в десятером, и я вам дам по 5 тисяч писем в день розобрать, за зарплату 5 тисяч в месяц… ти успееш ох обработать… то єсть, в месяц, на 10 человек получится 100-110 тисяч писем на всех… скажу тебе прямо… да ти после первуй сотни писем, отправлених такими как ти, начнеш головой, трогаться, єсли начнеш вникать, во все ваши видумки… представ  вот на скоко ти страниц прислал письмо… Арах ну на 40 страниц ето не много… Лев а дай тебе 500 таких писем в день,  получится 2тисячи листов в день нада прочитать… так 6 часов гдето читать по 3600секунд в часє, ето 20тисяч секунд… то єсть тебе нада прочитать один лист не дальше чем за 10 секунд… и понять, а идеии в етом письме, чегото стоют, или нет… я вот читаю лист минути 2, а ти? Арах даже для меня слишком бистро нада читать, я лист за 20-40 секунд читаю… Лев хихи даже 10 таких как ти не успеют просто прочитать, не то што розобратся… Арах хорошо, а што же ви людям, не предложите, штоб они вместо тисчи писем, сначала собрались в местє и написали єдиноє письмо «украинскому президенту» Лев опять двацать п’ять, ти думаєш в меня, кроме чтения писем, роботи нет? Арах слушайте, ви как маленький ребенок, ну чесне слово… вам не нада читать ети письма, вам нужно создать опитну команду… которая будет их читать, осли они принимаются, на основе етих писем команда создаєт генеральниє плани, коториє уже в готовом видє, отправляются или вам, или на места начальникам областей городов и так далее… Орел а можно по подробнее себе так хочу, ато надоїло из кремля, мусор лишний вивозить…     Арах смотритє идея техноцентра заключна в чем, ето зал для сбора обичних людей и кулибинов, существуєт такоє понятиє, как график работи етого зала… што ето значит люди зная график работи прийдут именно на то собраниє на котороє им нада… Лево куча води налита, и ничего конкретного… Арах в месяце єсть дни… допустим 1 число посвячено химии, слезутся все желающиє в науке химия… допустим второє число наука математика.. тоже слезутся с города, токо математики… третє число біологія соберутся біологи    четверте число електортехніка… п’яте число фізика….шосте число алхімія+алфізика+ альтернативна фізика… разом таким буде не скучно… і так далі…. Тобто люди яких цікавить певна наука…. Між собою там дискутують, спорять і так далі щось обговорюют, а під час цього процесу записують досить цікаві ідеї, котрі, в кінці дня наприклад, через інтернет відправляють на головний техноцентр… вони їх аналізують, говорячи собі, як же це надоїдає, потім викладають ідеї в інтернет, але з певною оцінкою експертів…. Можливо так робити, чи не можливо, є обґрунтування чи не має їх…. Лев ти сказав психолог порадила не маяться дурю… а своїм благосостоянієм пектися…     Арах це все класно, напишу сказку, викладу в інтернет, і від мене вже нічого не залежить, все що треба, я зробив, можно буде і про себе, як ви сказали, попектися..

Лисий скушай таблетку, моя конфетка…    Собака прервали на самом интересном месте, все, детям, можно и дальше смотреть… а жаль…. Все так хорошо начиналось…. Арах уважає мий Лев, можно я вас піддьоргну? Орел мне ето нравится… 	Лево чего, вообще обнаглел? Арах скажите ви ведь предприниматель не так ли? Лев ну сечас я президент, ну в самом деле… Арах представте себе што ви власник, и у вас єсть управляючий на заводе… ви захотіли проверить, как идут дела, а он вам в ответ, не положено, я управляю… Лев єслиб мне так сказал, вилетел би, на следущий день… Арах ну вот, а кто власник государства украина… народ, не так ли… Лев ну официально да…. Арах а не официально нет? Орел ги ги.. Лев и не официально да… Арах так почему же, владелец, не может спросить у управляющего, как он ведет дела… Лев пусть все вместе спрашуют… Арах как у януковича? Лев на што ти намекаєш… Арах ну виходит, штоб узнать, куда, што тратится, обязательно нада майдан? Орел ги ги… Лев не, ну не обязательно,… Арах но желательно?..... Лев да нет, ну сам не знаю…    Арах может украине стоит оприлюднювати в интернете, скоко куда и как потратили… какиє виплати по зарплатам, дебит кредит и так далее… Орел ого замашки… Лев ето государственна тайна… Арах тайна от кого, від власника? Лев ти намекаєш, што народ, должен поменять президента???? Арах ну кому єще мозг виносить, правительству, как не украинской аграрной елите…. Лев чего….  Арах ну да, я ведь мелкий в глаза… Лев издеваєшся… Арах даже и не думал… готови к серєзном розговору? Лев с тобой, к сєрєзном? Ладно попробую.. Цикало он попробуєт ги ги ги…. Арах што нада украине? Стабильность, верно? Лев согласен… Арах процветаниє, и развитиє? Лев согласен… Орел много ви хотите бездари…     Арах как ви хотите достич стабильности? Лев попитатся вировнять ситуацію, плюс кредити от МВФ… Арах ви знаєте за кредити МВФ в итоге нашу землю, для погашения кредита, в итоге когут забрать, ви ето понимаєте… Лев ну не должно до такого дойти, но в теории такоє возможно… Арах пока украина в силах виплачивать єжегодний платеж по кредитам, такого не будет… но может наступить момент… когда кредити станут на стоко большими, што не будет платить даже постоянний платеж, или не согласни… Лев хм в принципе так и єсть, тогда украинє могут прєдложить, погашать кредити продавать землю, при етом довольно дешево… Арах 20-50% от єє риночной цени??? Лев возможно й так… Арах значит на самом деле украине нужно по настоящем, поставить себе цель, по максимуму отдавть кредити, и питатся из не брать, штоб не било потом продажи с молотка… для погашения кредита, так можно и украину одним махом да и с людми продать, ток уви лишних людей, купившиє землю, виселят, а те кто останется, будут работать за гроши… Лев ну вообще то, возможно й так… Арах и перший период, в котрий ето может начатся, через десять лет… Лев ну етого, я не знаю, покашто, єсть чем платить єжегодний платеж… Арах платить, беря новий транш, ведь половина платежей так сделана… Лев не знаю на счет половини, но такоє биваєт… Арах и довольно часто? Лев не знаю как часто, ну точно не один раз… Арах а ведь когда ми берем кредит, штоб погасить старий, сума долга ростет… Кошка и платить ево придерся, ми токо отсрочиваєм, етим, гибель украини Лев ето правда… Орел а в росии проблем с етим нет… Арах у вас нефть єсть, не било б нефти, било би, тоже самоє… Лев нужни серєзниє инвестиции… Арах а кто может инвестировать, в государство, без гарантий… Лев єсть гаранти інвеститорам… Арах били би гаранти, били би и інвестори, а так інвестори, говорять што ложить, деньги в украину, ето как пойти к гадалке, штоб погадала, гадалки обично угадивают, но не всегда, уж поверте, как и ясновидящиє, шанс угадать зависит от класа способностей, сили екстрасенса, и тренировки, и находится от 50% до 90% иногда и повише… предвиденьє будущого, ето всего лиш, наиболее вероятний вариант… Лев блин, опять ти со своїм бредом… Орел опять араха несет … Арах вот смотрите я к чему веду што безопасность инвестиций 50-90% на самом деле… и не все хотят рисковать…    Лев может ти и передраматизировал… но риски єсть… ти мне лутше об’ясни, што ви за гади такиє… Арах скажем так уфологи любители+бившее кгб+сетка бивша+плюс там єще куча таких как я… Орел не поняв, а як ви собралися Арах бивше кгб нас собрало, по своїм архівним даним,  Орел че вашиє с нло зв’язуються? Арах из того што слишал, иногда получаєтся… откуда мне знать, правда или нет.. Лев ти понимаєш, в тебя будут огромнейшиє неприятности… Арах що я рекомендую, правительству укераїни перше, більшу частину бюджету, вкладати в центральний державний кредитний банк…. Дана кредитна структура, не бере депозитів від населення, так як вона, видає, лише без відсоткові кредити, як в японії, потім потрібно понять, що  відсотками за кредитом, є податки… Лев… треба доходи а не безвідсоткові кредити, треба птице фабрики, свиноферми… і так далі… Арах ви що, з дуба впали, нафіга державним підприємствам, виробляти продукцію рослинництва і тваринництва, державні підприємства, це ідеальне середовище, для розробки, і будівництва, держава має всі наукові інститути, необхідні, для створення технологій та заводів, тобто проекти фабрик і так далі… завдання держави, будувати підприємства, надзвичайно високого рівня, якого тільки можно… і продавати виробникам, або інвесторам, за гроші або в кредит… тобто завдання держави створювати виробничі потужності, а завдання приватних підприємців, користуватися ними так, щоб платити налоги, та мати прибуток, вони свого не упустять… Орел ти штото галдел, о повишении зарплат…     Арах смотритє на станке котором 67 лет… и даже хай 10-15 лет… уже нє будєт прибили штоб заплатить більше зарплату, даже єсли прєдприниматєль захочет… смотритє.. оборудованиє производит на 20 тисяч в мєсяц…. Зарплата, 2 тисячи в мєсяц, сирє на 14тисяч в мєсяц, доп рас ходи на 2 тищи в месяц, итого расходов на 18 тисяч в мєсяц, а с 2 тищ, што остаються нада, еще и налоги уплатить, и в прєдприниматєлю, останєтся в итогє тисяча…. Так от, а сможет ли он на ету тисячу, рабочему повисить зарплату до 10 тисяч????????  Ооооо штото нє так… пусть радується рабочий, што 2 тисячи плотят….  Лев и к чему ета демагогия… Арах а государство, должно разрабативать оборудованиє, к примеру производитєльность, с одним робочим, на 500тисяч в мєсяц, полу автомат или автомат… сиря оно потреби 70% от стоимости… на 350 тисяч грн., допрас ходи на 10 тисяч грн…. на зарплату, налоги и прибиль останєтся 140 тисяч грн…. а тут уже пожалуй, прєдприниматєль, даст зарплату робочем 40 тисяч гривен, но с условиєм, штоб он ідеально работал, на етом оборудовании, штоб брака нє било, штоб оборудованиє, нє портил, и так даліє и тому подобноє, и отчети постоянко составлял… то єсть, прєдложит рабочем зарплата… 5-10% от виробітки… єсли призведеш хуйню, то стоимость испорченого сиря, будет висчитано, из твоєй зарплати… Лев глупая система…     Арах а вот снегоход 1951-1953 год ленинград, скорость перемещения 120км в час, двигался за сет вращения 2метрового винта, лижи, изготовлени из резинового шланга, діаметром 10 см, длина лиж, по 4 метра, две лижи спереди, две лижи сзади, поварачувал, как трактор Т150, путєм сложения пополам… можно же найти чертежи… улучить по новом, и к примеру, обгрейдить, до моторной лодки, на лижах, и продавать как моторниє лодки плавающиє, со скоростью, 100-180 км в час… на большой скорости… лодка начинаєт не розрєзать воду, а скользить по водє, винт, находится в воздухє…. И начиная, из скорости 50 км в час, лижи  лодки находяться на поверхности води, а нє в водє…. Как вариант розработать, строить, и продавать, за долари… кажду єденицу, можно продать тисяч по 100доларов, при стоимости производства 10-50 тисяч доларов, в зависимости от технологи…. Там реально за 10 тищ доларов можно зафигачить гібрид снегохода, и лодки на лижах… когда лодка стоит, лижи на 60% занурени у воду, когда движется скользит по водє… одна лижа, прєдставляєт собой емкость из пластика, к примєру… ширина емкости 40см висота ємкости 60 см длина ємкости 5 метров, 4 таких лижи, соєденени в два агрегата… перший перєдний мост….. условно… на нем стоит кабина, а также запас топлива.. частино, задний мост, запас топлива, а также, двигатель с винтом, мости соєденени в систему, из гидравличним усилитєлем управления от руля… прикольна идея Орел идея хуйня, всє хорошоє, до тєбя придумали… Арах я не успокоюся, допустим фигня давайлє, сделаєм смесь кукурузника, гідроплана и вєртолєта…. Садится на воду, как гідроплан…. Имеется 4-5 крил, закреплених друг над другом, как в старого образца само летах, где двоє крил било, плюс, розшири мети крилья, за сет такой конструкции, теоретично, ми уменшим ширину захвата крильєв… на кажду сторону, по моном, реактивном двигатєлю с вертолєта… скорость етой хуйни,  будет от 300- до 500км за час… и продавать их….. а што для вертолєтов, уже нє годяться тєхнологии старих двигатєлей, новиє кручє, так давайте, детали старой воєн ой авиации… захерачим у гражданську авиацию, можно даже попробувати, зафигачить… гідроплани, с вертикальним взлєтом, полу вертоліт, полу само лет, когда он набрал скорость, вертолетниє винти, прєкращают вращатся, и к примеру автомат виставляєт лопасти, вдоль главной оси самолета, когда нам нада садится запускаєм, вертолетниє винти, а самолетниє глушим и садимся как вертоліт… и взлєтаєм как вертоліт… но на дальность, летим як само літ, думаєте ніхто не купе таку хуйню?....     Орел а ето типа, я сделал реактивного истребителя, с вертолітними винтами… и движком…. К примеру вивезли его на поляну в лес… взлетели, он розогнался в воздухе и спрятал винти… Арах русть даже и так… Орел а вот такоє меня уже и интересуєт… я би нє против кметь истребитєли… коториє когут взлєтать, как вертольоти, без аеродрома… Арах можно єще сдєлать, полу автомобили, полу вертолети, точнеє от нєобходимости он вертоліт, или же автомобіль, к примеру на базе грузового вертолета, напоминающего стрекозу… в переди… кабина пилота… соєденєна. Из длинющим хвостом и на 40% длини от всей длини хвоста, вобщем в первуй половин., закрєрлен винт вертолета, я так смотрєл… по фото… винти етого вертолета не виходять за предели длини вертолета, если их росположить вдоль, а ведь можно поставить к примеру фіксатори, штоб при єзде по земле, винти нє повернулися в бок, перед взлєтом, фіксатори убираються и лєти птенчик лети… в принципе ширина такого вертолета около 1.5 метров, длина около 8-10метров….. вполює его можно посадить, на автомобільний перєдний мост с рулем и приводом для автомобіля, газом и тормозим, педалей в кабинє будет на много більше просто, дає ще и автомобільний руль… котрий, єсли питатся им рулевать в воздухе ниче не даст, хотя на самом делє его можно приспособить до штурмвала, как в само летах, просто в воздухе, в него одни функции, на землє, ело руль… через гидроуправлєниє руля… прєдставим себе етот вертоліт, допустим нам на роботу нада летать нада из кончезаспия в центр києва… виєхали по типу автомобіля доєхали до ближайшей взлетной посадки, взлетели, долєтєли, до ближайшей до роботи посадочной посадки, перешли в режим автомобіля, и поєхали на роботу… Орел а че прикольно… ану єще штото ляпни…     Арах можно єще совтестить, истрєбитель, как вертоліт и автомобіль… то єсть, крилья, в городє, гидравликой подимаєм вверх, складивая как крилья бабочки, а когда нам нада, крилья росправляєм гидравликой, запускаєт, вертолетниє двигатєли, взлєтаєм вертикально, запускаєм турбини, и перєходим в режим истрєбитєля… а што класно… истребителем, по городу приєхали, заєхали в гараж.. пошли спать… утром сєли в истрєбитєль, виєхали на взлєтний майданчик, крилья росправили, запустили винти, взлетєли вверх, перешли в реактивний режим… така фигня пролетит 1тисячу км за час… а по зємлє движется со скоростю… 80км в час… люди на него долго будут смотрєть, как на НЛО… Лев дак кто их куплять будет даже єсли випустять автомобили-геликоптери… или автомобили-геликоптери-истребитєли… Арах боюся в первиє пол. Года, послє появления в продаже, половина верховной ради украини, купит себе такой транспорт… вот увидитє… они сорєвнуются в кого кручє дом, в кого кручє машина, а вертоліт-автомобиль кручє любого ферари… повертє, нашиє олігархи в радє, первиє на очерєди, кто купит…. Прєдставим такая єденица стоит милионов 5 доларов, наша верховна рада купит штук 1000, себе и родним… чем вернєт, часть спижених дєнєг из бюджета… плюс олігархи, во всєм мирє купят тисяч 100, виручка за десять лет до 1 трилиона доларов на автомобілях-вертолетах-истрєбитєлях, тут би ще лапку на 5% от етой суми положить… Орел слишиш, я чесно кажу тебе, смотри много хочеш, губа трісне…. Лев всє ето фигня…     Арах не хоче дядя так, то давайте ось як…. Построємо, центральнє,  водохранилище, герметичного типа…. Висоти 200 метров до 500 метров, столба води… Ширини 10 км длини 20 км…. Ето количество води скоко туда залить… с боку, делаєм, мощнейшу теплоизоляцию, а сверху делаєм кришку, верхняя часть к примеру орг. Стекло, и ишоб меж прослойками орг. Стекла, бил вакуум, ето даст…  тєплоизоляцию… одея така наша водица в ємкости с антибіотиком, штоб вода постояно била прозрачной… сверху в нас прозрачна поверхность, дає ще и термоизолирующая… солнечний свет… нагрєваєт ету ємкость….. при том до самого дна… за лето, теоретично вода может нагрєтся до 80-90 градусов и даже більше… а зимой ми ету воду, используєм, для нагрева води пришедшой с температурой 15 градусов, до температури 60-70 градусов, а потом догрєваєм… углєм к примеру и на тец… при етом, ми економим от 10 до 29% угля  теоретично… как говорил один друг, на халяву и укус сладкий, и можно много випить, лиш би на халяву… фу какая гадость… Лев нам такоє нє нужнок нам в администрацию прєзидєнта, от нескоких тисяч людей, подобниє идєии, приходять, хотіли би, уже взяли би, ну оно нам нє нада, ну нафиг оно оно нада, украина должна куплять нєфть, газ, уголь…     Арах я могу назвать вам «чудо богородици» ето Янукович» дєло в том, што ето чудо, што нашолся человєк, котрий смог, доєбать своєй политикой, украинцев так сильно, што они начали шевелится, как таракани… єслиб янукович, нє довбал всєх ужасно сильно, нє вилєз би майдан, в итогє, нє вилєз би я… цепная рєакция, янукович довбал народ… а снаго постояно деньги висасивают как кров, так било до януковича, по погной при януковичє, так єсть сєчас, токо врємя до януковича характєризовалось тєм, што люди, пошти всєгда молчали, при януковиче запрєщали язиком трєпать, а послє януковича, люди язиком трєщат што помелом, хотями ето радуєт, сєчас ви етого нє поймєтє, но и в правду, єслиби янукович нє достал людей, тєрки би нє началися….

И ето работая на хазяїна… котрий сначала виєбєт за недостачу, зама… или директора… потом технолога или прораба… потом бригадира или єщє когото, а робочим похую… пока з зарплати нє начнут списивать…    Лев всє фигня.. Арах а ви што, никогда нє жучили, за недостачу… Лев допустим приходилось, и при том часто… Арах а вот в государствєних заводах, нє особо замєтно, што жучат… просто списуют, а нєдостачю пусть бюджет погашаєт, а должни єбать всєх, наченая из директора, штоб аж кусти тряслися, потом директор єбєт нижшеє начальство… а потом начальство, єбєт робочих, вибора другого нєт… и уж повєртє, єсли робочий нє брал, он из остачей начнєт мстить хоть както…. Но иногда биваєт робочий взял, но всєравно мстит… ето жизнь… єсли он гадит на производствє, дєлая брак, нада его соотвєтственно нагибать, вичетая стоимость потєряну… в слєдущий раз, нє будєт брак єбашить…     Орел а для чего можно использовать вертоліт-автомобиль… Арах для скорой помощи, к примєру, вертоліт-автомобіль отєжаєт от больници…. На взлєтну площадку, взлєтаєт долєтаєт минут за 5-10 даже єсли--- занесло дороги снігом… к примеру, лєтом машина добираєтся полтора часа… то даже зимой, єсли всє занесло снігом, такая машина скорой помощи, примчит туда, минут за 5-10 нє дальше…. Она ємного уступаєт, стандартном вєртолєту в параметрах, но при етом єє прєимущєства, што она имєєт два рєжима, как вертоліт… и как автомобіль… по городу єздит, но также может, по городу и латать в принципє… интєрєсна мисль поскоку может приміняться в воєних операціях, для евакуации… к примєру, противник в опрєдєлєном раннє, контролируєт воздух, подлєтєть нєльзя, но по зємлє, можно подєхать, там где можно подлєтєть, он садится, дальше єдет по зємлє как автомобіль, берет евакуируємих, уєжаєт, гдє можно взлєтєть, взлєтаєт… или к примеру, на вертолєтє –автомобиле, стоит полний боєкомплект… он заєжаєт в нєпосрєдствєну близость к зонє боєв… и к примеру, взлєтая на висоту метров 4-5 над землєй крешит по противнику как вєртолет, в зону боєвих действий, так вертолєтом, на такой висотє не подлєтєть, фигня в том што радари, врядли єго опрєдєлят… то єсть пво автоматичне нє собєт… зато в бою резко появится прєимущество… вертолєти на полє боя,  при том што подлєтєть нєльзя… к примєру можно прєвратить вертоліт подобний к стрєкозє, в очень легкий БТР… оббшив кевлавром, и вообще полностью бронировав, и к примєру, поставив, двацать пулємєтов, коториє управляються джойстиком из кабини, всє стрєляют в одну точку к примєру пулями длиной 15 см діаметром 20-30мм… скорострельность одного пулємєта, 2-3 вистрєла в секунду… соотвєтствено у вєртолєта—120-180 вистрєлов за секунду… наверно секунди за три… рознєсєт нє большой домик в щепки…. И ето уже нє говоря што ети пули, когут бить начинєни взривчаткой, и взриватся при попадании, в таком вариантє, такой вертоліт за две три секунди, уничтожит лутший израильский танк, из противоракєтной защитой… штото я сомнєваюся што он может остановить сразу 100 миниснарядов подряд, думаю, максимум 5-6 за секунду, нє більше…     А вот єще, ето сугубо, по части господина Порошенко… с оного гектара земли   пшеница даєт прибиль до 1.5 тисяч грн. обачно, гречка до 3 тисяч, а виноград имеет трудозатрати 10-20 тисяч а вот виручка до 50-70 тисяч, может стоит украинском президенту, полялякать, с украинскими університетами, к примєру с магарачем… котрий в криму канєшно сєчас.. так поболтать по лялякать… Мишнев А.К. нє за долго до смерти сказал мнє так, уже около тридцяти лєт, в північній украинє, наблюдаются условия погоди, похожиє на тє, коториє ранше били у Криму… а вот крим пересол в боліє жаркий климат… и уже боліє 30 лет центральна та північна украина идєальниє условия для винограда… просто єдиная проблема, што ети рєгиони, нє считаются виноградарскими, и нє хотят дєлать производства по тому што для етих рєгионов нєт реєстра районированих сортов, и они считаются нє виноградарскими, поетому задача тєбє, от мєня, в своє врємя, когда оно наступит, сдєлать так штоб пєрєсмотрєли вопрос, сдєлав ети райони, виноградарскими… сказал тога когда наступит врємя.. какраз самоє самоє трудноє, ти поймєш што дєлать, я тогда єго нє понял.. так вот што нада от государства первує создать максимально, ефективну технологію обработки а также производство столбов, для підпорки винограда… думаю бєтониє столи прошлий вєк, пора би государству, дєлать мєталопластиковиє столби…. Внутр. Металічна труба, снаружи и снутри пластик… такой столб можно нє красить, пластик замєнит краску… и в столбов, придєлани ушки, для протягивания провода… затягуєт в столб провод, делаєм петлю, и протягуєм во второє ушко, и так к примєру дєлаєм полоси, виращивания длиной до 1 км, ширина міжряддя 2.5-4 метра… дєлаєм плантации… и к примеру, прямо под. виноградом, вирити рви… глубини 1.4 метра как в Баку или Сухуми,  на зиму… ложим виноград в ров, нон є закапуєм, а накриваєм плитой, фабричного производства… пластик плюс метал… слинки, рва тоже из вуглепластика, тонкого, ров, никогда нє засипається, а воврємя дождей туда набирається вода, котора поливаєт обильно виноград, грунт, на котором виращивать, песчаний чорнозем… пошти постояно ров накрит кришкой, кришка снимаєтся, лиш для того штоб положить туда виноград, или наооборот отуда витянуть… кажуть… лінь… двигатєль прогрєса… и ето правда, єслиби мнє нє било лєнь, на постоє закапивать и викапивать виноград… я би накривать кришкой нє придумал… в кришкє, когут бить заслонки, коториє на лєто откриваєм, штоб сквозь них, легко проходил воздух, п примеру 30% общей площади являєт собой дирки…. Но назиму закриваються и кришка, нє пропускаєт холодний воздух,  класна мисль лєтом, в кришки,  откриваєм заслонки… нє затухнет воздух и нє будєт перєизбитка влаги… плюс зимой єсли тепло, можно вєнтилировать, открив заслонки на дєнь… также осєнью и вєсной… єдинственоє снимать их в двоєм придерся… а для уплотнєния рам резиновиє, листи по краям придєлани, штоб можно било, на лето меж кришками, вуноград просунуть, прижав резину к кришке, а зимой резина, жмет друг на друга, и меж кришками, создаєтся герметичність… а виноград у нас под. кришками… и нє нада машин для видування лози из зємли… зачеп… на зиму в бункер прячем… бункер по другому ров виступаєт на 20-30 сантимєтров над зємлей и имєєт два слоя кришок… них ний… зимняяя на голубине 0.5 метров под. землей на зиму ложится в тов. … там спец крєпления для них ставим, а верхняя 20-30 см над зємлєй, ето всєсєзоная кришка, зима-лето, осень-весна… ето сдєлаєт укрив ну культуру, винограда разов в двацать дешевлє, в сфєрє укривання винограда… дєло в том, што нам копать нє нада послє постройки рвов, ми тратим лиш на то, штоб построить рви… весной подимаєм кришку, достаєм виноград, откриваєм заслонки, а осєнью, подимаєм кришку, ложим виноград, закриваєм заслонки… и нє нада вручну, копать… виноградарям любителям, и нє нада хитромудрих машин для видування воздухом… лиш нада ложить и доставать…     К примєру, вєртолет… можно прєвратить у мини грузовик… к примєру, для доставку груза, хотя на самомо дєлє, такоє уже есть… ето вертоліт грузовой, внєшнє, стрєкозу напоминаєт, цепляєтся стропами контейнер, и вертоліт его перетягуєт, такиє вертолєти удобно использовать в боєвих действиях, для доставки боєприпасів, притянули вертолєтом полний контейнер, поцепили, розгружений контейнер… полєтєли за полним контейнером, и к примеру он забираєт, прямо из корабля не садять, на корабль, на самом дєлє ето удобно, при висадкє войск… прєдставим сєбє, ми штурмом захватили побєрєжє, и нам нада бистро перебросит подкрєплєньє… в меня идея така… солдати залазять на контейнер, цепляются к нему страховками, вертоліт, забираєт контейнер, вмєстє с солдатами…  прилетаєт на берег… отцепляют контейнер от вертолєта, вертоліт мчит… по следущий.. количество человек котрих с контейнером может притянуть самая гругоподємная стрєкоза ну до 200 человек с контейнером… самая грузоподємная стрекоза тянєт 60-80 тон вродє, ну у солдат же не по 500кг веса.. а по 120-140 с екипировкой… плюс боєприпаси и жратва в контейнерє… там ений запас гранатомєтов, запас парк, пара бронемашин, легкого типа, типа хамеров, и так даліє… воєний хамер до 8 тон вродє важит… или же один контейнер перенєсет  такой вертоліт из одним танком…. А к примєру танкісти, его прицепят а потом отцепят… откроют контейнер залєзут в танк… и поєдут кататся на полє боя… ето методика переброса из корабля… на берег… аналогічно можно перебрасивать с берега на корабль…     Ця казка, є надпотужним інтелектуальним зерном, котре, мимоволі, посіється, майже в кожному, хто її прочитає, і не так важливо, чи він буде сміятися, бо насправді, вона виконає своє призначення, деякі мої думки та ідеїї, засядуть в душу, багатьом людям, котрі її прочитають, вона, почне їх змінювати, змінювати з середини, вони стануть іншими, почнуть задумуватися, а чи дійсно, вони живуть правильно, лише спостерігаючи, як інші, намагаються щось зробити, для користі, всім, мені далеко і до Кобзаря і до Лесі Українки, проте, це не так важливо, ви навіть не уявляєте, наскільки могутньою, буде технологія створення винахідників екстрасенсів, на основі відбору по днк а потім, високоінтелектуального навчання… такі вчені, будуть до 100 разів потужніші за звичайних вчених, в галузі створення нових ідей, коли зявится на землі до кількох мільйонів таких людей, а це станеться не тому, що я сказав… а тому, що таких, уже понад 10 тисяч, просто не всі, ще це зрозуміли…. Даю всім підказку як виявити, чи маєте ви здібності… правило перше, якщо в вас були дитячі фантазіїї в дитинстві, але не було жодних основ для їх створення, ви екстрасенс… правило друге, якщо ви часто відчуваєте ефект дежавю, в вас є всі шанси стати екстрасенсом, якщо вам раптово нізвідки зявляються думки, які потім збуваються ви предсказатель… якщо в вас сни які потім збуваються в вас здатність до ясновидіння і так далі… Фігня в тому що лише США цікавлять ідеї такого типу, росію зацікавлять, а україну ні -горбатого могила виправить, доки взагалі нічого не буде, а потім, пізно… модифікований магнітний двигун… ФАЄТОН. Теорія є якорний ротор, діаметру 300метрів, магнітний, а навколо нього статор із якорів діаметру 1м і менше, всі якорі, статора крутяться синхронізовано, між собою, через червячні редуктори, теоретично енергія витрачена на крутіння таких роторів рівна Х-кількість роторів, магнітна сила протидії роторів Фм, і діаметр роторів д1, точніше пропорційна…. Х*Фм*д1, а ось енергія отримана з чуда техніки пропорційна Х*Фм*косин угла відхил поля*кпд взаємодії… косин=0.5, кпд 20-50%.... Тобто витрата 1ХФм а прибуток 300*0.5*0.2*Х*Фм=30ХФм, теоретично вироблена енергія в тридцять раз вища, а ніж потрачена…. Тобто тратимо на запуск, якщо перевірено чи працює, і буде працювати, то витрачаючи на запуск 10твт, можна отримувати 250 твт…    можна згрібати різні органічні рештки в над великі ями висота 50м ширина 100метрів довжина 500метрів, закласти в них труби, забираючі тепло, температура воби на виході до 60градусів, продавати перегній, аза ті самі гроші, що продали перегній, купувати органічні рештки, смішно, але вже так деякі роблять… можна в грунт закопати термознімаючу колону діаметром 30 метрів довжини 50 метрів…. Як вона влаштована….. зовнішня труба діаметр… 50метрів… внутрі неї труба діаметром 49,8 метрів, прошарок між трубами 7 см, по діаметру, вгорі та внизу труби зварена між собою, утворюючи кожух…. Це так звана ємність забору тепла від землі…. В ній тече теплообмінний агент… вгорі та внизу, від цієї ємності, відходять патрубки, в сторону теплознімаючої тец…діаметр патрубків 40смдовжина 500метрів, тип циркулювання, пасивний…. Навколо тец по діаметру 20 таких колон.. по діаметру 500метрів….. використання тепла по чергово, шляхом, відкриття і закриття шлюзів.    Як прокопані тунелі для труб.. з допомогою «кротів» кріт. Це модифікований бур…  на відміну від звичайного бура, він має еншу головку зрізу пластів землі, як вона влаштована, на кільця діаметру 10 см та 45 см, наваренї зазубрені пластини, 12 штук, 10см кільце в центрі, 45 см кільце зовні, дана головка не просто ріже грунт, вона його перетирає як тертушка моркву, при щьому швидкість, її крутіння, 20-30 обертів на секунду, за 1 оберт, вона зніма 1 мм грунту…. Тобто, за секунду він прогриза 20-30 мм грунту, навіть на великій глибині… привід крота, електричний, через редуктор… двигун електроприводу.. 200-800гц… до крома приєднана труба із 40см діаметром, в середині якої, крутиться шнек, діаметр шнека 38см діаметр валу шнека 20 см, частота обертів шнека 50-100 обертів на секунду… привід ел двигун 200-800 герц, високої потужності… Як сказала аліса… не знаю, насчет…. 500 метрів, але перші 20метрів така гадость прогрезе за 5 хвилин, якщо буде можливість використати… але справа в тому що тут є варіанти, як її зробити, наприклад у варіанті діаметру 5метрів із 100 згризаючими пластинами, за один оберт згриза 0.1-1 мм, 20-30 обертів на секунду, і створювати тунелі для поїздів, встигай лише, вивозити грунт… тобто за годину можно прорити тунель… 72-720 метрів, теоретично, досит цікаво, тобто за день…(добу) 1.5км-15км… досить цікаво… якщо людина ходить зі швидкістю 5-7 кілометрів на годину… звичайна швидкість буріння складає близько 2-5 метрів на годину в наш час…    електромобіль Вимоги до ньго перша автоматична коробка перемикання передач, узгодження її з приладом, навігатора ДЖИПИЕС а також з приладом, що надає інформацію під яким кутом нахилу їде автомобіль, він їде вгору чи вниз, чи по прямій, а також узгодження з приладом, що визнача пробуксовування коліс…. Отже узгодження з джипиес…. Наприклад при виїзді на автобан, автоматичне переключення електромобіля в режим автобану, і максимальна швидкість наприклад 140 км на годину, проте при вїзді в місто електромобіля джипиес автоматично ввімкне режим місто… з обмеженням швидкості, і в такому випадку, навіть на найвищій швидкості, при повному втисканні педалі автомат не дозволить перевищити допустиму швидкість… тобто однакова швидкість, точніше передаточне число за наказом автоматики через джипиес дасть максимум в місті 60км на годину, на шляхах з обмеженням 80км на годину швидкість 80 км на годину а на автобані наприклад 180 км на годину… тобто фізично електромобіль наприклад при повній викладкі здатен давати швидкість 180км на годину, але джипиес регулює максимальну швидкість… Прилад що інформує автомобіль їде в гору чи вниз, також автоматично спрацьовує, якщо електромобіль їде в низ під великим кутом автоматично на мінімальне передаточне число редуктора, якщо електромобіль їде вгору під великим кутом, автоматично перемика на максимальне передаточне число редуктора і максимум частоти обертів електродвигуна… Пробуксовування коліс, теоретично може викликати необхідність, так званої не залежної підвіски, колеса крутяться з різною швидкістю… здається так, не знаю, думаю таке можливо.. Також стоїть електроавтомат зміни частоти електроструму в залежності від швидкості, та підсилювач електро сигналу, чим менша частота тим потужність сигналу менша, чим вища частота тим потужність сигналу більша. Отже наша електромашина, повинна бути розрахована на більш менш стабільну швидкість, не залежно їде вона в гору чи в низ…. Від того що їде в гору сильно росте енерговитрата але швидкість суттєво не падає, якщо їде вниз енерговитрати мінімальні, швидкість стабільна….    тепловий генератор випаровування…. Теорія всі ми знаємо…  що вода має певну насиченість і точку роси, ідея полягає в тому, що в низу стоїть гігантський випаровувач, котрий, гріється від світла, а також, від навколишнього середовища…. Випаровування екстенсивне, стоїть над випаровувачем вертикальна труба, по якій, повітря насичене вобою, підіймається до гори, і якщо, труба добре термоізольована не охолоджується… на висоті наприклад в 2-3 км, вона переходить в верхню частину, охолоджувача… охолоджується там повітря на стінках виступає конденсат…. І збирається вода в водонапірні колони, з котрих, при необхідності направляється на водяні колеса, вони починають крутитись і генератор дає електрику… Тобто теорія така внизу повітря наситилось вологою, піднялося вгору перейшло в охолоджувач.. в горі охолоджувача на висоті 3 км температура куди нижча ниж біля грунту, повітря охолодилось пада по теплоізольованій трубі вниз до випаровувала знову гріється і зволожується підіймається вгору і зацикльовується… в низу випарувалась вода… в горі конденсувалась, конденсат пада на колесо згори, воно крутиться… перемінні магніти, абож теорія про те, що можна одночасно крутити синхронно 1000 якорів, розташованих паралельно, що створить ефект перемінного магнітного поля, на основі постійного магнітного поля… може використовуватися в ел двигунах як статор, а макож використання магнітних поршнів…. І так далі     про те що можна створити дископодібну ємність, діаметру 200метрів товщини 100 метрів, наповнити її повністю водою, на краю диску, знаходиться водяниу шланг, котрий… переходить до центру диску, коли ви розкручуємо диск навколо своєї осі, дуже сильно, він в певний момент досяга свого максимуму, далі, відкривається затвор шланга і вода здатна видавлюватися з диска але відцентрова сила врівноважує воду в диску і воду в шлангу, але ми запускаємо в диск повітря, котре, почина створювати залишковий тиск, це змушує воду, котра відцентровою силою давить на стінки шланга проходити по шлангу, до центру диску, і виливатися на зовні від центру диску, якщо хто добре зна фізику він зна якщо вагу що крутиться по орбіті 10 мерів притянути на орбіту 5 метрів, швидкість обертання збільшиться тут те саме ми вагу води, притягуємо до центру за разунок тиску повітря і виливаємо. На зовні при цьому диск вест час нарощує швидкість свого обертання такий диск якщо був повен, і мав швидкість обертання 100 обертів на секунду, якщо воду злити указаним методом, то кількість обертів виросте до 1 тис-30тисяч за секунду…. Тому що по суті ми всю вагу води витягли до центру тобто вона була на діаметрі 200метрів, а ми її перетягли на діаметр 0.01метр, в центр обертання і вилили, тому вся сила енергії потенціала, залишиться в диску що крутиться, не знаю, що це дає, але прикольна ідея…    створити гігантський ковпак, на морі, в котрий випаровується вода з моря пари, підіймаються на висоту до 1 км, починають конденсуватися, падають в жолоби збору конденсату, по жолобам стікають до зрошувальної системи…. Поливаються рослини…. Вода в морі солона під дією сонячного проміння випароується солі залишаються в воді, на великій висоті, вода конденсується і конденсат попада в жолоби, по жолобам стіка в систему зрошення… ми гиготали, цікава ідея… весь ковпак зроблено зі скла, або орг. Скла, вобщем солнечний свет проходит, и тепло вплоть, до самого верха, где воздух охлаждаєтся, вода конденсується, не теряєтся…. Теоретично такоє стоит строить в африке, накривать землю гигантскими ковпаками, што превратит их в теплицу…. И сделать ее термоизолированой, чутли не до верха… раз мер теплици… ширина 10 км, длина 20 км, висота 1км,  в чем єє суть когда в природе, в сахаре жара, влажний воздух испаряєтся и улетаєт, теплица, же, с грунтових, вод, винуждаєт, испарится воду но вода, не куда не исчезаєт… а остається в воздухе теплици…. В верху конденсується в спец жолоба, после чего, набирається в орощительниє колони, одна такая теплица позволяєт виращивать урожай на 1км квадратном как минимум, но на самом деле на всей площади, как в растенях формируєтся урожай существуєт понятиє транспирационного коефициента, скоко води долино испарится, штоб получить 1 грам урожая…. Или в масе растения или масе плода… пшеница 400-600 и так далее к примеру там 1000 тоєсть для формирования 1 грама урожая нужен 1 литр води…. Но в сахаре, вода спарилась и улетіла, и нада нова вода… но вот вотета теплица, улетевшу воду, конденсуєт, вернет в орошательну систему….. и предварительно, штоб вирастить в такой теплице 1 кг урожая нужно в нее из вне добавить 2-5литров води…. Не рациональниє то єсть лишниє, потери води всеравно будут…. Но смотрим внимательно, когда ми делаєм полив… растениє в себя впитиває 20-70% води, которой ми ево полили, плюс транспирационний коефициент… поетому штоб виростить 200центнеров с га растєнєводческой продукции,  нада 300тисяц центнеров води или більше, то єсть 30 тисяч тон води, при етом в зациклированой нада до 1000центнеров води, то єсть до 100тон… то єсть в 300-800раз менше, чем при обичном виращивании. Режим работи людей в теплице, работа кипит ночю, а днем люди баю баю… свят вобщем… кстати так живут многиє страни, в котрих днєм жарко, ночю работают, днем свят, аж сопут… украинци скажут нада работать днем…. Какая нафиг работа єсли днем 50 градусов а ночю 20-25…, украинци при 36 градусов днем, не знают куда им дерся… от жари… а єсли 50 градусов, и ето в тени…. Я не говорю што на сонце, а в тени деревєв вдумайтеся…. В них там дома сделани так, што днем, туда, теплий воздух, фактично не заходит…. Зато ночю, они впускают в них ночнуююю свежесть…. На самом деле теплицу можно строить всево лиш висоти 20 метров или менше, огромной  площади, сверху накрить так називаємой, прозрачной кришей, с полосами… солнечних батарей… 2/3 криши закрито полосами солнечних батарей….  Што уменшаєт, солнечний поток, в сторону растений в три раза… ето сделано будет для того… штоб растения не поварилися, солнечна енергія тратится на електрофункционированиє теплици, електронасоси, ночноє освещениє и так далее, а также на роботу кондиционеров, к примеру, каким образом? Внутр. Теплици испаритель теплици(охладитель), снаружи, система теплоотдачи теплици…   Арах пане президент можна вас запитати…. Орел мене? Лев чи мене? Обама мабуть мене…. Арах як ви вважаєте якщо я спробую підколядувати, добровільними внесками людей грошей на рахунок, в мене вийде? Лев врядли, ну а єсли получится, тебе прийдется оплатить налог, в фонд налого обложения по братски, процентов 99нам и один процент себе… Орел я и то не більше 25% забрал… Обома все налоги, уплачиваются в рамках закона…. Лев я же пошутил…     Арах всем кому понравилась сказка, и хотят добровільно перечислить деньги на сет, указую номер счета приватбанк украини номер карти 5168 7554 0952 6817, прохання до приватбанку, перекидати при поступанні грошей на цей рахунок, на інший, для того, щоб хакери нічого не сперли… вот такі ось казочки…. Лев ти думаєш, ти щось заробиш… Арах «мишка» підрахувала що від 0 центів і більше…. Якщо вдасться коляднути, хочаб по 1 центу, в 1 мільйона людей, це вже буде 10 тисяч доларів, теоретично, якщо мені все вдасться, по копійкі може зкинутися до 100мільйонів людей, а це в теорії… можуть бути не малі гроші…. Проте приймаються пожертви від мінімуму до безкінечності, якщо хтось виявить бажання, пожертвувать пару мільйонів, чи навіть мільярдів я не проти…. Хоча насправді, мабуть, не буде жодної пожертви.. Орел о какой, пару милиардов захотел, а губа не трісне.. Арах повторяю ще раз, куда слать добровольниє взноси, я ведь никого не смогу заставить, или скажете, я стоять буду, з нагайкой, и слідить хто скоко заплатит? номер счета приватбанк украини номер карти 5168 7554 0952 6817 Орел слушай как тебя по настоящем звать… Арах ну вообще Александр, имячко арах ето прилепили люди, весь прикол в том, што мои напоминают сложную интелектуальную паутину, поетому меня прозвали пауком, потом ето превратилось в арахнид, потом в Арах… вот так и возник, мой псевдоним Арах, а што єсть проблеми?    Орел ну ти и офигевший и яке у тебе ремесло… Арах. Наше ремесло, тіньовий інтелектуальний спецназ.. Кішка м’яук м’яук м’яук… Арах складання анекдотів, принципових, технологій, та інше… Обома а ви не думали в америку на роботу встроится… Арах ну єсли мне в украине роботу нормальну не найти, почему и нет, кака зарплата? Обома начнем с не большой суми, средней зарплати в США, а там посмотрим… лишниє документи, сжигаєм, штоб чужим не достались.. Лев што за мода все сжигать… Арах ви ведь тоже, некоториє вещи сжигаєте Орел масони… как же ви надоєдаєтє… Арах ну єсли можно штото, сделать, без денег, а почему и нет… Орел часто ти пишеш невидимими чорнилами?... Арах я могу обичними написать так, што ви нечего, там не поймете…. А другиє люди поймут…  Орел давай валяй….    Арах Смотритє, ви хотите космічний аерофлот? Орел канешно хочу…. Арах смотрите, штоб сделать воздушниє авианосци, нада сделать ядерниє реактивниє двигатели…. То єсть влепить внутр. Реактивной турбини, маленький атомний реактор…. Ето позволит авианосцу, если не сломаєтся, авианосец, или турбина взлететь, и не садится на землю до 80 лет…. Или к примеру, самолети на таких турбинах… могут по 80 лет… турбини маслать….. к примеру, для взлета и посадки нада на самолет, поставить еще електротурбини, а на атомниє турбини, прицепить енергогенератори, в самолете, или авианосце мощниє електроакумулятори…. То єсть взлет…. За счет електротурбин, в воздухе, запускається атомна турбина, и летит само лет скоко нам нада, не за долго до посадки, атомний реактор приостанавливаєм плавно… штоб не рвонул и не перегрелся… запуская електротурбини, то єсть взлет и посадка на електротурбинах, а весь полет на атомних турбинах, время нахождения в воздухе используя к примеру тяжолу воду, до 80 лет… при скорости около 2 тищи км в час…. Пощитайте дальность, на каку долетит самолет если не сломаєтся, єсли за сутки облетит вокруг земли, по екватору, в одном году 365 дней, то єсть самолет, способен не садять, в теории облететь 30тисяч раз по екватору, без єдиной посадки….всю землю… об’ясню просто народно, ето как в гоголя редкая птица долетит, до середини днепра… так в жизни редко какой само лет, способен облететь вокруг земли, а вот атомний, теоретично, способен 30тисяч раз облететь…. Орел хи хи нада подумать… такоє, росия, точно начнет розрабативать… при том, што такиє турбини, єще и дают возможность строить, воздушниє авианосци….    Била в мєня идея сексуальних игр… Вариант перший аналог бутилочки…. Сначала в кругу, где стоят люди, внутр. Стоит человек из зав’язаними глазами, он сам начинаєт крутится а люди громко щита ют скоко он оборотов сделал дощитуют до 10 оборотов, потом мол чат, а человек самостоятельно должен еще докрутится 4-6 оборотов и остановить руку в каком то направлении, тот на кого он указал, штото с себя снимаєт, и одеваєт повязку на глаза начинаєт крутится люди считают до 10 оборотов потом мол чат он еще крутится 4-6 оборотов потом останавлюєт руку, в каком то направлении…. Ето виходит бутилочка, в которой роль бутилочки, виполняєт человек роздевающийся… Вариант номер два так називаємий вибор имеениника, іменинник или именниница, в свій день рождення вибираєт всліпу, с кем пойдет на свиданиє, єй или єму завязивают глаза, и она облапився потенциальнох партнеров, или же он облапиваєт, вибирают партнера с котрим пойдут на свиданиє…. Вариант номер три парни стоят в темной комнате к примеру 20 парней, запускают в нее 10 девушек с зав’язаними глазами, парням запрещено мшать де вушкам их лапать, но де вушка обв’язана вибрать облапився парней, какого нибуть парня для свидания…. Ох ми и гикали…. Єсть ведь еще и версія номер два, парни лапают девушек, вибирая на ощуп ту, с которой пойдут на свиданиє… ржали аж заливалися представляя как ето….. даже видос видел как люди чудили ето парни стояли с зав’язаними глазами, и девки с зав’язаними глазами их трогали, а потом на оборот, просто во всех били завязани глаза, штоб парни не видели кто их лапаєт, а потом девушки не видели кто их лапаєт… «мишка» ржала и «алиса» тоже представ себе, стиит в спортзале 300 девушек… с зав’язаними глазами…. И туда запускают…. 100 парней с зав’язаними глазами, они должни себе найти де вушку, там утухали представте себе девушку, котору облапали 10 парней, што єй делать, если захочет кому то, дать ляпаса, она ведь не знаєт, кто лапал… или на оборот парень не знаєт кто лапал, «мишка» сказала пипец сексуальне влечениє к взрослим теткам…    А вобще в меня прикольна ситуація, с интернетом компании києвстар, подключил по моєму в лютом 2011 года, мне дали такую личную страницу для управления услугой интернета києвстар… што ни я ни мастера по настройке, при помощи каких либо временних паролей, не смогли воспользоватся, так на нее ниразу не вошли…. Звонил в техслужбу висилали времениє пароли, питался войти результат один и тотже, не возможно войти, при етом києвстар говорит она справна, мастера говорили никогда не видели такого… такое вообще не возможно, как такоє, может бить, и вот сечас в марте я узнаю через людей, што не просто я не смог воспользоватся ниразу бонусами, по домашнем интернету, а єще они и сгорят… да да сгорят, потомушто києвстар их себе забираєт, так как бонуси будут сгорать каждий месяц… а вот из лютого 2011-по 11марта 2015 года так и не воспользовался ни разу, а 11 марта переподключат, не предупредив зараннє, я сам немного не догнал… ну мне просто сказали придут переподключать 10 марта…. Вопрос што компанія києвстар по етому поводу может сказать, как они собрались об’яснять, и буде тли хотями работать страница управления интернетом, хотями после того, как они скушают, такиє желаємиє ими, бонуси, наверно им повезло, они совершенно случайно попадают, в ету сказку, как компанія не виполняющая своїх обязательств… а разве виполняют, єсли даже их специалисти, не смогли, зайти никак на страницу, куда уж мне, барану… меня даже, не интересуєт компенсація, мне чисто інтересно, а чи в силах врешті решт спеціалісти компанії київстар, котрі заявляють що вона справна, її налаштувати… бо я так поняв, що і вони не можуть на неї зайти, чи це така політика в київстара, вони зайти можуть бо поставили інший логін, чим у мене чи як…. Логіном являється номер рахунку… але по барабану, ставили і тимчасовий і що тіки не ставили… і наново замовляли зробити сторінку, в мене просто ги ги такого імовірність менше одного на мільйон, але знаючи моє везіння, я не здивований, те що із всіма може статися з шансом один на мільярд, в моєму випадку, вважай 100%...     Вобще, булоб цікаво, якби прилетіло НЛО, і пристало до українських політиків, чому вони нічого не роблять, щоб народу україни було краще… Сценка прилетіло нло, висадились інопланетяни, пояснили армії, що вони прилетіли, з миром, щоб пояснити, українським політикам, що треба робити, щоб було краще, армія погодилась, пояснюйте… Політики почали ховатися по під столами, накриваючись папками з документами, і вигукуючи нас тут не має, ми поїхали, на невизначений термін, у термінову відпустку, і не шукайте нас під столами, нас тут немає… і доки ви не полетите, нас тут не буде… Один із самих відважних, виявився кличко, став у боксерську стійку, готуючись, до спаринг поєдинку, з інопланетянами, і почав, казати, чого вам потрібно, фіолетові чоловічки… в цей же час вершиною відважності стала, тимошенко, озброївшися нагайкою, із секшопу, та наручниками, цікаво, де вона їх взяла… Фіолетові чоловічки, ми прийшли з миром, не треба нас боятися… Кличко знаєте, у фільмі марс атакує, марсіани теж казали, ми прийшли з миром, а закінчилося бійнею… Фіолетові чоловічки, якби ми прийшли з війною, ви б про це, не дізналися… бій би закінчився за 1 секунду…. Тимошенко але це як, так, за 1 секунду… Фіолетові чоловічки, був би потужний викид електромагнітних хвиль, котрий би перетворив, вас на тушковане м'ясо за 0.1секунди…. Кличко а чого його не було, чого ще живі…. Фіолетові чоловічки ми прибули, розповісти, як швидше розвиватись… Тимошенко, ви бачете, що я нервуюся, вперше зустрілась з інопланетянами, так донервувалася, що сама себе закувала,  руки у наручники… осталося понять, як користуватись нагайкою, із скованими, за спиною руками… Кличко, ги ги, шлепай себе по сексуальніше… Тимошенко да як ви могли на мене так подумати, що я така…. Кличко а яка нормальна людина, в себе на роботі, такі речі тримає…. Тимошенко це не мої, це я своїй сусідці позичила… Клико не робіть із себе святу, вам це не личить, такою, з нагайкою… ви всім подобаєтеся, щеб ви вміли користуватися, нею, на своїх колегах…. Тимошенко а я це добре вмію, ойой здається лишнього сказала… Кличко отж бо, по вам видно, що в вас опит…. Зелені чоловічки що ці фіолетові тут забули, ми принесли вимоги донбасу, Юліє Володимирівно, а що це з вами…. Фіолетові чоловічки здається у верховній раді, відкрили секс шоп…. Кличко хіба це секс шоп, продажів лише на 500мільйонів доларів за місяць, хоча насправді, це потрібно, щоб списувати недостатки бюджету…. На робочі матеріали, засідань верховної ради… презервативи, білизну, наручники, нагайки… і таке інше, потрібно ж, на щось списувати, нехватки, в держ бюджеті…. Фіолетові чоловічки ми в серйозній справі… Зелені чоловічки здається хтось став фіолетовим, бо випив багато, фотопроявителя…. Фіолетові чоловічки, ви стали зеленими, бо постіно п’єте зеленку?.... Зелені чоловічки постійно в бункерах знаходимся…тому позеленіли… Фіолетові чоловічки а в нас це звичайний колір шкіри…. Зелені чоловічки бо на вас постійно експерименти ставлять,  восьмиокі , з чотирма парами грудей, як у свині… шестирукі, з одним членом та з двома пездами… Фіолетові чоловічки, а яка вам різниця, що в нас така анатомія, ще й по вісім пальців на руках і ногах, ви за собою дивіться, щоб ще дужче, не позеленіли… Тимошенко а можна питання, в вас один член, і дві пизди, ви гермафродити… Фіолетові чоловічки, в нас немає поділу на чоловіків і жінок, але в нас перехресне запліднення…     Анєгдот услишаний от людей… Бегаєт вокруг мами маленький ребено, вдруг остановился, а спрашуєт.. Мама а мама скажи а што ти кушаєш, што живот такой большой, пре большой.. В ответ мама, нет синочок, живот большой, потому, што твой братик ростет… Тут уже ребенок спрашуєт, мама ти говорила, што єсли я пальци буду лизать, внутри Меня глисти появятся, в меня вопрос, а што  лизала ти, што сначала появился я, а тепер єще и братик появится… Повторю еще раз куда слать добровольниє пожертви.. номер счета приватбанк украини номер карти 5168 7554 0952 6817 Орел ну ти и лошак…. Лев, не лошак, а дурак…     Арах да ладно, я би на месте президентов, росии и украини, создал заводи, для производства, максимально, дешового оборудования, високого качества, и продавал такоє оборудованиє внутри Страни, по контракту, а што, пусть и дурак, зато мисль, класная… Орел а єсли перепроизводство…. Арах да в том же и суть, што нада сделать, максимально качествене оборудованиє, и призводить, максимально качествену, продукцію, и в огромних об’єм, к примеру єсли автоматика, себестоимость, будет не на много више, чем в китая, а качество к примеру європейскоє, в китая європа пошти не покупаєт, а точнее покупаєт но, для європи екстра клас из китая а нам фуфло, на большее не тянем… Лев как ето, не понял…. Арах дав от так, вот смотрите япония, где производится, техника японського, производства, не в японки, а в китає, кстати, в японки, розрабативают технологи, а вот производственниє мощностя в китає…. Плюс япония видаєт беспроцентниє кредити, тем кто создаєт предприятия, а процентами, являються уплачениє налоги… Лево ну ми же не япония, нам нада своє… Арах што украинци вмеют лучше всего…. Орел хуйней страдать… Обома не понял вопроса…. Цикало скомуниздить у всех по чучуть, и сделать штото своє, и сказать, што ето я сам придумал, хотя на самом деле, ето детали, из того што другиє придумали…     Арах вот, цикало светлая голова, в украинцев, ето получаєтся саме лутше…. Так давайте не стеснятся, етой способности, и скажем миру, ми хотим у вас взять наилучшее, што ми можем в вас взять, к примеру компютерниє технологи, в японни, авто производство в США й Німечини, и так далее, не стесняясь, не дадут… смотреть што на порядок ниже можно випросить… не обезательно ведь випрашивать, безплатно, ктото про мафію чикаго, читал? Там єсть такоє понятиє, как доля в дєлє, то єсть ктото ишол на дело, и компанєни, требо вали свою долю из прибили…. А почему не использовать етот опит… договорится к примеру, с компаниєй форд… они там какуюто, модель уже снимают, с производства, но помагают, украине, настроить производство, у себя етой модели…. За ето они получают не кий процент прибили… украина получаєт, производство, болем менее востребованой модели, автомобіля, и єсли она будет, довільно, дешовой, не факт, што даже європа, не буде тих покупать, малообеспечиниє, в європе станут куплять, єсли ето дествительно, будет качественно… и так даже те самиє пентиуми 4ире… они начинают п’яти призводить, а нам дали технологію, третих, и наладили производство, за што получают свою долю…. И к примеру через год ми начнем випуск пентиумов четире… а они випускать пентиуми п’ять, и не факт… што в тоже самоє время, ми не будем випускать пентиум п’ять, єсли оправдаєм их довериє, они заключат с нами контракт, што они дают технологію, настраюют производство, и за ето получают не кий процент от прибили…. От 10 до 25% от прибили, к примеру… єсли, к примеру уже партнери притерлися, друг к другу, то впоєне возможно, што партнер розработчик, не станет сам производство делать, а отдаст сразу, партнеру, с украини, он потратил деньги, на розработку, с процента от прибили, он вернет деньги, потрачениє, на розработку, плюс заработаєт…. И украина на етом заработаєт…. Просто нада забить о таком правилє, украини… єсли я заработал деньги ето токо моє, и більше нічиє, нада прибилью с партнерами, учится делится, єсли ето даст вигоду, што вам партнери скажем, так вам настроить оборудованиє, и производство как для себя…. Тут виходит как завод пренадлежит хазяїну, но он заключил контракт, с японцами, и по контракту, он к примеру, делаєт, автомобили, по самой передовой, технологи японки, себестоимость машини  50 тисяч грн…. продаєт по 80 тисяч грн…. раз ница 30 тисяч грн., платит налог 25%, остається 22.5тисяч грн., отдаєт 20% партнеру ето 5 тисяч грн…. производителю остається 17.5 тисяч грн…. то єсть вигодно и партнеру, он разработал технологиию, сам не производит, но она окупається, и украинскому производителю вигодно, в нево японскоє ноу-хау, брендовая технология, произведенная в украине, а как 90% японской техники производится в китає, а почему нельзя в украине призводить, можно, и даже нужно…. Правило мафии чикаго 20-40 годов 20 столетия, в бизнесе, будет работать, безотказно, лучше швейцарських часов, єсли не забивать, давати долю в деле, своєму партнеру…. То єсть… што єсть украина может стать страной, єсли хорошо, в етом планє, себя зарекомендуєт, производящей, 90-99% всех лутших, технологий мира, и теоретично, с етого, будут, не просто милионниє прибутки, а трилионниє налоги, в год…. Такоє придумала наша фінансистка «мишка», она експерт по таким делам, я так слишал, одна из лутших, експертов в мире…     Єще одно по поводу патентов, на фантазии, прощитали што местом, подписания, договоров, на использованиє фантазий, или технологий, на основе етих фантазий будет києв, США лично для своєй страни Вашингтон спец отдел подписания договоров, в Росии в Москве спец отдел, подписания договоров… в принципе такиє отдели когут бить, в любой стране… но тога… они должни кметь право…. Заключить к примеру сіделку в таком же отделе Токио…. Не токо на такиє технологи, а и любиє сделки… коториє, обачно, нада заключать приєхав к комуто…. То єсть договора заключонниє, в двух техночентрах один Києв второй Токио   должни кметь такую же юридическую силу, как и договора…. Заключонниє если с украини приєдут в японию, или на оборот….. смисл етого, допустим, никто не станет впер виє заключать договор, на три года через него, приєдут, но тем не менее єсли и тех. И других, заключонний договор устраюєт, или они хотят, заключить новий, они впоєне, когут обратися в соответствующиє техноцентри, и через интернет, продлить…. Договор, или вообще, заключить новий договор, ето уменшит расходи на поїздки, делегацій для подписания договоров…. Приетом, техноцентри, за подписаниє договоров, на ростоянии, получат некотору суму, денег…. Котора будет, гораздо менше росходов, чем би партнери оправились на встречу… и да за использованиє етой идеии єсли така не запатентована, тоже стоило, би виплачивать, роялті… хи хи…. Єще один момент все патенти из идей имеют минимальний какойто процент, но все патенти берут роялті, без ограничения времени…. Ето как допустим патент 25% от стоимости на протяжении 10 лет…. В даних идеях процент роялті от патентов в 2-10 раз менше, чем обачно…. Но роялті…. Сниматся по такому проценту, будет не токо через 10 лет…а и к примеру и через 100тисяч лет єсли украина, росия и США доживут до того момента, то єсть уменшеноє роялті, но вечноє…   . И второй момент по роялті от фантазий, к примеру, в год плотится 100млн доларов роялті…. Половина роялті…. Падаєт на некоторий банковский счет банка украини, желательно, при етом банк гарантируєт безопасность етих денег…. Каждий год, банк начисляєт проценти, к примеру 10% годових, половина процентов, идет на видачу получателям, а половина процентов возвращаєтся на счет… то єсть, єсли в мире за год уплачивают по 100 млн доларов в год с роялті…. 50 млн доларов делится между украиной росиєй сша и арах или наслідниками… а 50 млн ложится на банковский счет…. На второй год к примеру виплачено 120 млн доларов роялті 60 млн доларов делится… 60 млн доларов ложится на счет… плюс к етому, из 50 млн доларов насчитали проценти, 5 млн доларов, половина из них вернется на счет,  а половина к видаче тесть на счету будет 50+60+2.5=112.5 млн доларов… а получатели роялті розделят 62.5 млн доларов К примеру на третий год виплачено 140 млн доларов, 70 млн доларов падаєт на счет, 70 млн доларов делится между ясно кем…. Плюс процент со счета будет 11млн доларов и 200 тищ, к примеру… они делятся пополам, 5,6 милионов вернется на счет, а 5.6 млн доларов будет розделено…. На счету будет 112.5+5.6+70=183.1 млн доларов… И к примеру со счета деньги никогда не делятся, то єсть на счете токо накапливаются, а делятся токо проценти от сумми, пополам, одна к виплате….вторая назад на сет….. просчитав, єжегодную прогресию, не сложно понять, што через 100 лет…. Виплата из счета, процентами, будет даже більше, чем уплата самого роялті, то єсть процентов виплачено 300млн доларов, а вот уплочено 200 млн доларов за год… через 1000лет…процентов виплачено… 5 трилионов доларов а уплочено роялті…300милионов доларов, и даже, если через 10 тисяч лет не будет виплат роялті, ети технологи не будут использоватся, сумма всеравно єжегодно, будет рости, и будут виплачиватся ети деньги…. По скоку от суми накопленой в банках, будет ежегодно не кий процент… половина котрого, вернется на счета, а половина будет виплачена… … што касаєтся наследников арах…все делится поровну, меж наслідниками, по родословной то єсть к примеру… в арах дочка в нее троє детей, и син в нево 150 детей… деньги делятся между… 1(дочка)+3(ее дети)+1(син)+150(ево дети)=155 человек…. То єсть сумма поделена между 155 людьми, следущее поколение к примеру уже 10 тисяч детей… 10 тисяч+155=10155 людей поровну, и так далее. Казалось би со временем, сума получаемая каждим следущим поколеним падаєт… но тем не менее, ето может бить не так и мало… если дело вигорит…  Што касаємо денег, ем не обязательно што всегда ето будут токо долари, возможен переход и на болем ста бильну валюту, к примеру на всепланетну….. и например вхождениє європи в состав украини…. Китая в состав росиии, канади в состав сша… и так далее … єсли украина, росия или сша, обєденятся путем референдума стран то их роялті сумиряється…. К примеру украина+сша 25%+25%=50%.... ИЛИ ЖЕ УКРАИНА+РОСИЯ 	но путь обєденения токо референдум…. И никаких воєнних путей, кто начинаєт войну росия сша или украина, тоже в ето пусть входит на 10-15 лет не получают виплат, в етом варианте, меж наслідниками арах и остачей делится доля… которая не виплачена… тесть по 33.333 каждой стороне или 50% наслідникам арах и стране не воєвавшей последниє 25 лет, или вплоть 100% наслідники арах если все три страни, первими начинали войну, єсли на страну на пали, она имеет право защищатся…. При етом виплата роялті не приостанавливаєтся, а вот ответноє нападениє єсли мировоє сообщество скажет правильно… не лишаєтся виплат, а єсли скажет не правильно, лишаєтся на строк от 1года до 25 лет, в зависимости от ситуации… иногда страни сильно провокуют, штоб на них напали первими, штоб в друг чего сказать нанесли ответний удар…. За такоє, от 25 до 50лет лишениє виплат роялті странам єсли ето будет доказано… ну как ето, типа да ви не нападете, у вас кишка тонка, ви лузери и так далее, в росиян такоє биваєт…. Они иногда, так провоцируют… хотя наши не на много иногда отстают… «мишка» ржала, єсли начнет уплачиватся роялті, теоретично, я могу побить мировой рекорд, по количеству жон, одновременно, я и сам ржал што лошадь… представив што к примеру 2 тисячи жон…. Хотя не смішно… с одной попробуй справится…. Я єє спросил, а вот ти би стала моєй женой, она ответила, заработаєш пару милиардов, можеш повторить вопрос, а так мультимилионерке ти не ровня… на разних счетах до 200 милонов доларов…. Такиє как я не интересуют… вобще моє мне ниє 1-2 всамий раз, не більше 10ти… я немного прикалуюся но….. в принципе…. Інтересно би попробувати сразу з двома встрічаться, щоб одна про одну знали, і взагалі, в трьох… ток не говорите што я такой перший, я о таких наслишан…. Около 1% населения таким страдаєт…    Когдато, я таким вопросом, добил одного священика, говорю, а вот єсли я хочу, встречатся сразу с двумя или десятьма де вушками, так можно? Священик ето прелюбодействиє, так как ти изменяєш одной…. Я єму, а єсли девушки согласни што я с двумя сразу, ведь виходит, спя з одной из них, я получаєтся второй и не изменяю, по скоку она знаєт, и согласна на ето… Священик я…я не могу ответить, тут как би и грех, и как би нет по всем фактам нада бить с одной женой… Я ево решил добить, говорю вот в євангилиє, указиваєтся што некоториє люди служащиє богу, к примеру имели двух жон…. Священик не двоєжонствуй… Я єму а єсть такой закон бога, знаю не прелюбодействуй, и знаю не возжелай жени ближнего свого… а о двоє, троєжонстве… и более я не читал… виходит єсли три девушки согласни, бить одновременно знач можно… Священик ето тебе не ислам, в библии строго одна жена…. И штото, еще там сказал…. Блин я слепой, правда не все в библии прочитал, наверно где имеенно указано што в человека должна бить одна и токо одна жена… наверно пропустил… а вот в библейних расказах указиваєтся и две и гдето вроде, більше жон… и в етих росказах нет осуждения… Я не пререкаюся с библиєй, я просто раздумиваю, над тем, а сто процентов 1 жена или все же, их может бить две… или три… но даже самого терпеливого человека, можно розозлить, и тога, из тихого болота, может випригнуть в образном смисле, чертенок, размером с материк…. Блин инфа што в библии, нигде конкретно ниуказано, што нельзя кметь много жон походу, конкретно не указано, на оборот, многиє святиє имели більше одной жени… хи хи… проверял и вот смотритє сами…   Первым примером многожёнства / двоежёнства в Священном Писании является Ламех в книге Бытие 4:19: «Ламех взял себе двух жён» (тут и далее используется современный перевод Российского Библейского Общества). Несколько выдающихся мужей в Ветхом Завете имели нескольких жён. Авраам, Иаков, Давид, Соломон и другие жили в полигамии. Во 2 Царств 12:8 Бог, говоря через пророка Нафана, сказал, что если Давиду было недостаточно своих жён и наложниц, то Он дал бы ему ещё больше. Соломон имел 700 жён и 300 наложниц (фактически, жён нижнего статуса), согласно 3 Царств 11:3. Как нам быть с этими примерами полигамии в Ветхом Завете? Следует ответить на три вопроса: 1) Почему Бог позволял многожёнство в Ветхом Завете? 2) Как Бог рассматривает полигамию сегодня? 3) С чем связаны изменения?  1. Почему Бог позволял многожёнство в Ветхом Завете? Библия не говорит конкретно, почему Бог позволял полигамию. Размышляя о молчании Бога, следует учитывать несколько ключевых факторов. Во-первых, в мире всегда было больше женщин, чем мужчин. Текущая статистика показывает, что приблизительно 50,5% мирового населения относятся к женскому полу. Допуская, что похожее соотношение имело место и в древние времена, женщин было на десятки тысяч больше, чем мужчин. Во-вторых, войны в древние времена были особенно жестокими, с чрезвычайно высоким уровнем смертности. Это приводило к тому, что соотношение ещё больше перевешивало в пользу женщин. В-третьих, из-за патриархальных сообществ незамужней женщине было почти невозможно обеспечивать себя. Зачастую женщины были необразованными и неподготовленными к самостоятельной жизни. Они полагались на своих отцов, братьев и мужей для обеспечения и защиты. Незамужние женщины часто были обречены на проституцию и рабство. Значительные различия между женщинами и мужчинами оставляли многих женщин в неблагоприятном положении.  Поэтому, вероятно, что Бог мог позволить полигамию, чтобы защитить и обеспечить женщин, которые не могли бы найти мужей иным путём. Мужчина брал многих жён и служил кормильцем и защитником для всех них. Хотя, несомненно, это явление было неидеальным, жизнь в полигамном семействе была значительно лучшей, чем альтернативы, существующие в то время: проституция, рабство или голод. Кроме фактора обеспечения / защиты, полигамия вела к более быстрому распространению человечества, отвечая Божественному указанию: «Будьте же плодовиты и многочисленны, заселяйте землю» (Бытие 9:7). Мужчины способны оплодотворить многих женщин в один и тот же период, приводя к тому, что человечество росло значительно быстрее, чем если бы каждый мужчина давал жизнь лишь одному ребёнку раз в год. 2. Как Бог рассматривает полигамию сегодня? Даже позволяя многожёнство, Библия представляет моногамию наиболее точно соответствующей Божественному идеалу брака. Библия говорит, что Божье первоначальное намерение было, чтоб один мужчина был женат на одной женщине: «Вот почему мужчина оставляет отца и мать, и соединяется с женою, и становится с нею единой плотью» (Бытие 2:24). Хотя указанный текст скорее описывает, чем является брак, а не то, сколько людей в нём участвуют, следует обратить внимание на постоянное использование единственного числа. Во Второзаконии 17:14–20 Бог говорит, что цари не должны иметь многих жён (как и лошадей или золота). Хотя данное указание не может истолковываться как указание царям быть моногамными, его можно воспринимать как утверждение, что наличие многих жён ведёт к проблемам. Это можно отчётливо увидеть на примере жизни Соломона (3 Царств 11:3–4).  В Новом Завете 1 Тимофею 3:2, 12 и Титу 1:6 упоминают о мужчине, женатом «не больше одного раза», в списке качеств духовного руководства. Хотя эти качества относятся непосредственно к духовным лидерам, они должны ровным образом применяться ко всем христианам. Не следует ли всем христианам быть людьми «безупречной жизни… трезвомыслящими, рассудительными, степенными, гостеприимными, способными учить, не пьяницами, не драчунами, умеющими владеть собой, мягкими, не задиристыми, не падкими до денег» (1 Тимофею 3:2–3)? Если мы призваны быть святыми (1 Петра 1:16) и если эти стандарты являются святыми для старейшин и диаконов, тогда они святы для всех. Послание к Ефесянам 5:22–33 говорит об отношениях между мужем и женой. Говоря о муже в единичном числе, оно так же всегда говорит и о жене. «…Потому что муж – глава жены (в единичном)… Кто любит жену (в единичном), тот любит себя… Вот почему оставит человек отца и мать и соединится с женой (в единичном), и станут двое единой плотью… Каждый (в единичном) из вас, должны любить своих жён, как самих себя. И жена (в единичном) пусть почитает мужа» (в единичном). Хотя параллельный текст в Колоссянам 3:18–19 говорит о мужьях и жёнах во множественном числе, очевидно, что Павел обращается ко всем мужьям и жёнам среди верующих Колосс, а не утверждает, что муж может иметь многих жён. В отличие к этому тексту, в Ефесянам 5:22–23 конкретно обсуждаются брачные отношения. Если бы полигамия была разрешена, то иллюстрация отношений Христа с Его телом (церковью) на примере отношений между мужем и женой не имела бы смысла.  3. С чем связаны изменения? Бог не столько запретил что-то, прежде разрешённое Ним, сколько восстановил брак к Своему первоначальному плану. Даже возвращаясь к Адаму и Еве, полигамия не была первоначальным Божественным намерением. Вероятно, Бог позволил полигамию, чтобы разрешить проблему, но это – не идеал. В большинстве современных обществ абсолютно не существует нужды в полигамии. В большинстве культур сегодня женщины способны обеспечивать себя и защищать, упраздняя единственный «позитивный» аспект многожёнства. Более того, большинство современных народов запрещают полигамию. Согласно с Римлянам 13:1–7, мы должны подчиняться законам, учреждённым правительством. Единственным случаем, когда непослушание закону разрешено Священным Писанием, является то, когда закон противоречит Божьим заповедям (Деяния 5:29). Так как Бог лишь позволяет полигамию, а не утверждает её, закон, запрещающий полигамию, должен быть исполнен. Существуют ли случаи, в которых разрешение полигамии все ещё может быть применено сегодня? Может быть, но непостижимо, чтобы не было другого возможного решения. Из-за аспекта брака, состоящего в «одной плоти», необходимости в единстве и гармонии в браке, а также отсутствия реальной необходимости в полигамии, мы твёрдо убеждены, что многожёнство не прославляет Бога и не является Его замыслом относительно брака.   Вобщем, што ето нафиг, означає, што єсли розобратся по библии, толком, то к примеру, иметь две и більше жон, не запрещено, но… первоначальний план бога, в том, штоб многожонства, небило, по возможности… но при етом, не запрещено…. Чуствуєтся разница… етого однозначно не запрещено….. но приетом, библия все же говорит, в принципе изначальний план, одна жена… но может бить и більше… и вот именно вопрос какраз и состоит… в том, што может бить більше…. Священик заявил, єму нельзя більше… ето правда… так как он должен соответствовать изначальном плану…. Но библия не запрещаєт иметь много жон…. Дальше класно, но в семє, не долино бить більше одного мужа… блин, все как и в видении, почему вот три жени аморально, ну не превично просто.. тем не менее не запрещено…. Но два мужа, не встречаєтся нигде в библии, и вроде как в семє везде в єденичном екземпляре, указиваєтся… хи хи….    Почему библия, не запрещаєт, а точнее, сказать розрешаєт, многожонство, на случай войни, когда мужчини идут на войну, они погибают… в таком случає, на одного мужчину, может оказатися 10 женщин, и аби не нарушить, план божий и штоб, количество потомства, не упало…. Мужчина должен взять, в библии сказано не может, а должен взять много жон, єсли мужчин очень не хватаєт, для женщин. То єсть, многожонство розрешено- да, но оно било разрешено богом изза того што били войни, и для многожонства все те же закони не возжелай жени ближнего свого и не прелюбодействуй, но в тебя 10 жон…. Вот інтересно…ктото скажет когда спиш с одной женой, изменяєш остальним, и многожонство, на самом деле, более всего, не приветствуєтся с морали и етики… єсли к примеру, я возьму две жени, и буду токо с ними, и они будут друг о друге знать, и будут обе согласни, прелюбодействия нет… А вот по більшому счету, нужди в многожонних браках нету, но они не запрещени, класно? Там просто нужно штоб в таком браке били согласни бить мужчина и две или болем женщин, даже количество не ограничено… почему ми и представили, а вот вдруг, 2 тисячи жон и сміялися долго…. Там не у всех жон, будут дети, наверно….. соломон бил наверно, ну очень винослив, в етом плане… Соломон имел 700 жён и 300 наложниц в «мишки», когда представила, волоси дибом стали… Єще один інтересний момент випливающий из библии, мужчина, может взять вдову в жони… но впер виє обвенчатся с нею, он не может… по скоку, она визначально, била обвінчана с другим…. То єсть ето все значит што, мужчина, может обвенчатся с девушкой один раз… в принципе не факт што в первом венчании, он не может обвенчатся, сразу с 10 жонами, што так нельзя, не указано… потом… мужчина может брать еще жон, єсли вдруг жони не против, но тут влазит акт номер два…. Он на должен етим рас торгнуть второй брак, то єсть он не должен отбить жену у мужа….. он может взять в жони женщину, бившей замужем и брак роспался по двум причинам перва муж погиб, втора муж и жена розбежалися но не по вине, того кто берет ее в жони… чужих жон отбивать грех.. иметь 10 жон виходит не грех, а вот отбивать жон, тяжкий грех, прикольно… и иметь половиє отношения с 10 женщинами не грех, виходит, если все они согласни с етим, и являються жонами мужчини… в таком случає нет ни греха, не прелюбодействуй, не измени по другому, и нет греха не возжелай жени ближнего свого, как же ближнего, єсли жони одного мужчини… ето не желательно, правда, но не запрещено…    Мне очень інтересно, а що скаже церква, по цьму поводу… об сексуальних меншинах… геїв если де вушка сексом, с ним займется(изнасилуєт, одним словом), можно перенаправить пошти всегда…. А вот лесбийку, если изнасиловать, она не просто, не перестанет бить лесбийкой, она на пушечний вистрел, мужчину не подпустит…. А вот как же в таком блин случає… виходит так, што ем некий мужчина, должен вести с такими девушками так, штоб на первом етапе, добится того штоб, она на первом етапе, от него не убегала, хотяби… на втором етапе, свободно себя чуствовала, а на третєм-четвертом, етапе захотіла попробовать… и єсли єй понравится… станет из лесбіянки или бисексуалкой или гетеросексуалкой… Вобщем в чем фишка, почему девушкам нравятся девушки, вся суть што девушки ужасно ніжно, относятся друг к другу, я психологію сексуальних меншин, изучал, по интернету и книгам по психологи.. мужчини геии довільно грубо меж собой контактируют…и когда женщина ласкаво ево насилуєт, иногда, ето им начинаєт, нравится куда більше, чем секс с парнями, А вот тепер обломитесь штоб де вушка, захотіла после секса с парнем, єще с ним секса, парень, должен бить куда ласковее, чем другая девушка, а как такоє достич, єсли попитатся изнасиловать, не вийдет… в етом то и вся фигня…. Што парень с лесбиянкой, должен бить не менее, ласковим, чем ее сексуальная партнерка, в таком случає лесбийка, или начнет и з етим парнем мутить… и из сексуальной партнеркой, или токо с парнем… еще может и остатся лесбийкой, но в случає, єсли лесбийке понравится не менше, с парнем чем девушкой, она с ним єще замутит…   Вот ради чего девушки мутят, с друг дружкой, в 80% случаєв штоб поласкать друг друга, ето из иследований какого то там центра… и в 20% любов с первого взгляда… условно говоря, ой стакими трудности будут… фишка в том, што такиє девушки, начали любить девушек, не изза того… што им не понравился секс с парнем, они даже, не пробивали, и отвергают мисли об етом…. В таком случає, огромна проблема… и психіатр, может ити, и нервно курить в сторонке, ща буду питатся об’яснить политику партии, што же с такими делать… Етап один, сделать так, штоб девушка, не дергалася увидєв парня… Етап два, сделать так, штоб девушка не боялася с ним говорить… Етап три, сделать так, штоб девушка, не обижалася на комплименти, и другиє знаки внимания… Етап четире, сделать так штоб девушка не боялася гулять с парнем.. Етап п’ять сделать так, штоб девушка не боялась руко пожатий от парня… Етап шесть, сделать так штоб девушка, не убежала, куда глаза глядять… увидів полуобнажоного парня, обнажоного может испугатся… Етап семь сделать так штоб девушка не сбежала, испугавшися обнажоного парня… Етап восем.. сделать так, штоб у девушки проснулся інтерес, полапать парня… Етап девять спросить у нее разрешения ее потрогать.. єсли розрешит.. Етап десять ну там уже лизания по погной, очень ніжно ее мацая… Етап 11 очень ніжно ее трахнуть… Ну а дальше ніжно ніжно и понеслась по накатаной…  Не ну проститут обикновенний, живет пошти в каждом, межчине, єсли нет… то виходит… ево путь к сексопатологу… почему, ето природнє влечениє, мужчин к женщинам…. Оно подавляється, в мужчинє, єсли он постоянко живєт, с одной женщиной… … Очень увлекательна наука о том, как феромони, отбивают, у мужчин желаниє тягатся… ето роздано самой природой… штоб мужчина, найдя свою женщину, перестал, бросатся на всех женщин подряд, изза того што в него гормони ключом бют… и через малий промежуток времени а ето месяци, проживання, рядом с одной и той же девушкой, в мужчини, перестают бить гормони…. Вот так…. ЭНДОКРИНОЛОГИЯ Мы наивно полагаем, что самостоятельно принимаем решения, по собственной воле к кому-то проявляем интерес, а кого-то отвергаем, по собственному желанию соединяем с кем-то свою судьбу. На самом же деле очень многими нашими поступками – особенно, когда речь идет об общении с противоположным полом – руководят удивительные, полные загадок и тайн химические соединения – гормоны. Женщины являются женщинами во всех смыслах слова и со всеми вытекающими отсюда последствиями именно под воздействием женских гормонов. Мужчин это тоже касается, только руководят ими мужские гормоны. Впрочем, в каждой женщине есть немножко мужчины, и в каждом мужчине – немножко женщины. В гормональном значении этих слов. Женские гормоны ЭСТРОГЕН - это самый женский гормон. Его синтезируют яичники. Эстроген обуславливает регулярность менструального цикла, у девочек вызывает формирование вторичных половых признаков (увеличение молочных желез, рост волос на лобке и в подмышечных впадинах, характерную форму таза). Кроме того, при половом созревании эстроген помогает организму девушки подготовиться к будущей сексуальной жизни и материнству - это касается множества моментов, связанных с состоянием наружных половых органов и матки. Благодаря эстрогену взрослая женщина сохраняет молодость и красоту, хорошее состояние кожи и позитивное отношение к жизни. Если количество эстрогена в женском организме соответствует норме, женщина, как правило, чувствует себя замечательно и зачастую выглядит моложе своих сверстниц с нарушенным гормональным фоном. Эстроген несет ответственность и за женское стремление нянчить и защищать свое гнездо.  ФАКТЫ: Так как эстроген имеет успокаивающее действие, его дают агрессивным мужчинам в тюрьмах - считается, что это помогает справиться со вспышками гнева. Эстроген также улучшает память. Именно поэтому женщины в период менопаузы, когда угасание функции яичников вызывает падение уровня эстрогена в организме, часто испытывают трудности с запоминанием. Обычно справиться с этим помогает гормонозаместительная терапия, которая оберегает женщину в климактерическом периоде, да и от других неприятностей, связанных со здоровьем. Эстроген заставляет женский организм накапливать жир. Женщин это очень огорчает, но вызывает энтузиазм у животоноводов: благодаря введенному в корма эстрогену сельскохозяйственные животные замечательно набирают вес. Показатель высокого уровня эстрогена в крови и, следовательно, высокой способности к зачатию ребенка - светлый цвет волос. Возможно, мужчины, инстинктивно чувствуя плодовитость блондинок, имеют к ним повышенный интерес. Однако после рождения первого ребенка уровень эстрогена в организме женщины снижается, темнеют и волосы. Двое-трое детей, и муж удивляется, почему у его любимой жены-блондинки потемнели волосы.   ПРОГЕСТЕРОН - гормон, способствующий своевременному наступлению и нормальному развитию беременности. Прогестерон вырабатывается желтым телом, плацентой и надпочечниками. Его называют гормоном родительского инстинкта: благодаря прогестерону женщина не только физически готовится к рождению ребенка, но и переживает психологические изменения. Прогестерон также готовит молочные железы женщины к выработке молока при появлении ребенка.  ФАКТЫ: Уровень прогестерона в крови у женщины повышается, когда она видит маленьких детей. Некоторые исследователи считают, что это вызвано сигналом, условно названным ""формой младенца"". Установлено, что повышение прогестерона в крови женщины вызывает вид маленького, пухленького тельца с большой головой и большими глазами. Эта реакция настолько сильна, что прогестерон активно выделяется, даже если женщина видит ""младенцеподобную"" мягкую игрушку, например, мишку. Большинство же мужчин остается совершенно равнодушными к мягким и толстым игрушечным медведям.   ПРОЛАКТИН - этот гормон вырабатывает гипофиз, железа величиной с горошину, расположенная в головном мозге. Биологическая роль пролактина заключается в обеспечении роста и развития молочных желез и интенсивной стимуляции выработки молока в период кормления ребенка. Этот гормон называют стрессовым - его содержание возрастает при повышенных физических нагрузках, переутомлении, психологической травме.  ФАКТЫ: ""Несанкционированное"" повышение уровня пролактина может вызывать заболевания молочных желез - например, мастопатию, а также неприятные ощущения в молочных железах во время ""критических дней"".   Мужские гормоны (андрогены) ТЕСТОСТЕРОН - самый мужской гормон. Он вырабатывается надпочечниками и яичками. Тестостерон называют гормоном агрессии. Он заставляет мужчину охотиться и убивать добычу. Благодаря тестостерону мужчина настроен на обеспечение пропитания и защиту своего жилища и семьи. В современном обществе этот гормон таит для мужчин некоторую опасность, ведь для того, чтобы прокормить семью, теперь нет необходимости бегать по лесу и метать копья. Для того чтобы уровень тестостерона удерживался в норме, мужчине нужна физическая нагрузка - современные представители сильного пола заменяют древнюю охоту современным спортзалом. В период полового созревания уровень тестостерона в организме юноши стремительно повышается, благодаря чему он превращается в поджарую, быструю и целеустремленную ""машину"" для добывания пищи. В этот же период под воздействием андрогенов юноша превращается в мужчину, способного к оплодотворению.  ФАКТЫ: Благодаря тестостерону у мужчин растет борода и увеличивается вероятность облысения, становится низкимголос и развивается способность ориентироваться в пространстве. Обладатели более низких голосов демонстрируют более высокую сексуальную активность. У людей, прошедших лечение тестостероном, улучшается способность к чтению дорожных карт. Уровень тестостерона понижается у людей, чрезмерно употребляющих алкоголь, а также у курящих. Более низким становится уровень тестостерона у мужчин и в 50-60 летнем возрасте, они становятся менее агрессивными и охотнее нянчатся с детьми или другими своими родственниками. Мужские гормоны, среди которых тестостерону принадлежит ведущее место, не пригодны для использования в сельском хозяйстве - ну кому нужна мускулистая корова или свинья? Зато стероиды, мужские гормоны, активно употребляют спортсмены с целью быстро нарастить мышечную массу. Делают это не только мужчины, но и женщины. Впрочем, и те, и другие расплачиваются за употребление стероидов гормональными расстройствами. ""Общие"" гормоны Андрогены (в том числе тестостерон) в женском организме вырабатываются в небольшом количестве в яичниках и в надпочечниках. При некоторых заболеваниях уровень андрогенов в крови у женщины повышается, что вызывает повышенный рост волос на теле, понижение голоса. Поэтому, если вас, милые дамы, беспокоит количество волос на различных участках тела и их расположение, для полного успокоения обратитесь к эндокринологу - он объяснит, что является нормой, а что - отклонением от нормы. Не пугайтесь понапрасну: определенная степень волосатости присуща вполне здоровым женщинам.  ФАКТЫ: В период климакса у женщины понижается уровень женского гормона эстрогена и повышается уровень тестостерона. В 45-50 лет женщина может стать более самостоятельной и решительной, чем раньше и обнаружить в себе способности к предпринимательской деятельности. Из недостатков такого сюрприза природы - вероятность роста волос на лице у женщины, склонность к стрессам и повышение вероятности развития инсульта. Ситуация становится критичной В период с 21-го по 28-й день месячного цикла уровень женских гормонов в крови резко падает, что приводит к появлению острых симптомов подавленности, известных под названием ""менструальная напряженность (МН)"". Именно эти дни можно с полным правом назвать критическими. Не случайно же большинство женщин чувствует себя в этой фазе, мягко говоря, не лучшим образом. Именно в этот период женщины становятся раздражительными, агрессивными, утомляемыми, плаксивыми; у многих нарушается сон, усиливаются головные боли; кто-то даже впадает в депрессию; у некоторых появляется угревая сыпь, боли внизу живота, нагрубание молочных желез, отечность ног и лица, запоры, повышается артериальное давление с головными болями до тошноты и рвоты. Это связано с избытком (эстрогена) или недостатком (прогестерона) гормонов. Нечто подобное происходит и в климактерический период (обычно в 40 или сразу после 50 лет): женщина претерпевает значительные психологические, эмоциональные и гормональные изменения. Гормоны и секс Известно, что гормоны и секс тесно связаны друг с другом. Прежде всего, секс способствует выработке эндорфинов - так называемых ""гормонов счастья"". А они, в числе многих эффектов, обладают и обезболивающим действием. Поэтому, если болит зуб - самое время заняться сексом. (Кстати, секс, как интенсивная физическая нагрузка, улучшает кровообращение в организме, в том числе и в полости рта. Это делает более здоровыми десны и предотвращает возникновение многих стоматологических проблем.) И это еще не все. При регулярной половой жизни в организме выделяются также такие гормоны, как адреналин и кортизон, которые стимулируют работу мозга и предупреждают мигрень. Медики считают, что секс повышает наши способности сосредоточиться, стимулирует внимание и творческое мышление. Кроме того, сексуальная активность продлевает жизнь: те, кто занимаются любовью регулярно (не меньше 2-х раз в неделю), живут гораздо дольше тех, кто вспоминает о сексе менее раза в месяц. Потерпите, ведь вы же мужчины! Терпеть боль помогает мужской половой гормон тестостерон. Как установили американские ученые, он снижает уровень дискомфорта, делая человека менее восприимчивым к болевым ощущениям, способствуя выработке естественных обезболивающих - энкефалинов. Правда, пока продемонстрировать верность этого утверждения удалось только в опытах на воробьях. Дела семейные Отношения в семье также подвластны гормонам. Причем важно, в какой пропорции сочетаются уровни тестостерона у супругов. Оказывается, мужчины с уровнем тестостерона в крови ниже среднего отлично себя чувствуют в браке с женщинами, у которых того же гормона - выше среднего уровня. Такая жена отлично поддерживает мужа, обладает более гибкой психикой и лучше понимает мужа - ведь высокий уровень тестостерона делает человека более напористым, а это может выражаться как в агрессии, так и в желании помочь близким. Если, например, у обоих супругов уровень ниже среднего, то и здесь есть положительный момент - они более позитивно настроены при обсуждении семейных проблем. Совместив все данные, ученые и пришли к революционному выводу - прежде чем жениться, узнайте уровень мужского гомона у себя и у своей избранницы. Иначе, как же вы будете решать проблемы? Поняли штоб бить жеребцами, обикновенними, то єсть проститутами обикновенними, желательно, штоб рядом, не било женщин, тога может появится желаниє, затянуть, перву попавшуся….  Всем известно, что в организме женщины каждый месяц происходит процесс овуляции, в эти дни нередки перепады настроения. Но знаете ли вы о том, что и на настроение сильного пола также влияют мужские гормоны? Если вы хотите лучше понимать своего избранника, вам необходимо поближе познакомиться с тайной жизнь мужских гормонов. Также как и в женском организме в мужском происходят циклические процессы, только в этом случае их несколько. Один из них связан с созреванием сперматозоидов, порой данный процесс длится около 74-х дней. Другой медики сравнивают с месячным циклом у женщин: в это время у мужчин также происходят сильные колебание настроения, порой они могут разражаться из-за мелочей или обижаться на нас. Происходит это по причине гормональных колебаний. Существует мнение, что на самочувствие мужчины и на сексуальное желание также влияют и фазы луны. Так, к примеру, в период новолуния и полнолуния у него просыпается неуемное сексуальное желание. Как женский организм не способен на нормальное существование без мужских гормонов, так и мужской не обходится без женских. К примеру, гормон эстрадиол, который вырабатывается у женщин в надпочечниках и яичниках, присутствует и в организме мужчины, производящийся в яичках, периферических тканях и надпочечниках. Данный гормон довольно важен для мужчины: от его количества напрямую зависит возможность иметь здоровое потомство, также гормон отвечает за крепость костных тканей. Бытует мнение, что чем больше в организме мужчины гормона тестостерона, тем сильнее и мускулистее должен он быть. В действительности данный гормон никак не влияет на массу мышечной ткани, а вот на силу сексуального желания сильного пола – в первую очередь. Поэтому сильный мускулистый мужчина навряд ли сможет похвастать своими достижениями в постели, а вот щуплые на вид представители сильного пола заставляют трепетать от удовольствия своих партнерш. Все дело в том, что мощные мускулы, широкие плечи и тяжелая челюсть относятся лишь к вторичным половым признакам. Нередко на фигуру мужчины влияет и наследственность, так у крупного папы чаще всего рождаются такие же сильные и мускулистые сыновья. Тестостерон вырабатывается в организме мужчины не постоянно, а определенными циклами, поэтому в зависимости от времени суток уровень гормона может изменяться с большой разницей. Пик тестостерона наблюдается у мужчин в промежутке между двумя часами ночи и шести утра, это объясняет постоянное желание мужчины заниматься сексом в утренние часы. Самый низкий уровень тестостерона в крови – около часа дня. Если женщина хочет оставаться желанной для своего мужчины ей придется подстраиваться под все изменения, происходящие в его организме.     От «мишки» фінансистки, в меня щас єсть ужасно, дибильная идея… шо она подсказала, вот есть сайти знакомств… и там мужчини розмещают… свои передложения… так вот она предложила, в сказочку загнать своє предложениє, для знакомства с девушками… предлагаю попитатся слигатся со мной, девушке, от 18 до 30 лет, желательно без невидимих друзей, типа сифилис и прочиє венеричниє болезни, а также такие типа спид, и прочее в етом репертуаре, я умоляю вас, єсли ви, знаєте или предполагаєтє, што у вас такоє может бить, ну будь ласка, не нада приходить….

Доктор время йдет, а врач, діагноз пишет…    Арах мне нравился проект три звезди… Доктор хотите об етом поговорить… Арах Можно снять проект, три звезду… или три пизди… как то так… Представим пели в проекте песню  Ех милий, послушай милий, моє сердечко, не отпускай, ех сонце, моє ти сонце, мяня сечас ти, не упусти… Ех мила, послушай мила, тебя я точно, не упущу… Да да да, горит звезда, да да да, горит звезда…  А тепер испоганиваєм для проекта три звезду….  Виступают токо мужчини… Ех милий, послушай милий, меня ти в попку, не опускай… Ех сонце, послушай сонце, тебя по ходу, сечас возьму… Ех милий, не нада милий, меня ти точно не опусти… Ой да да да, а где пизда, ой да да да, а где пизда…… Ех милий, послушай, милий, послушай чесно, ведь я мужик… О да да да, в тюрьме, пизда, о да да да, щас трахну я… Ех милий, послушай милий… не когут я, ех милий, послушай милий, не когут я… Ах да да, да ет все фигня, ет да да, возьму тебя….  Сука сочиняєм и утухаєм сами… надаюся, всє тоже будут ржать..    Доктор какиє не здоровиє у вас фантазии… Арах доктор ето реали жизни,  смесь того, што стаєт с теми, кто насилуєт девушек менше 18 лет, такоє било, да и думаю, єще иногда єсть… а также виступлений певцов… Доктор а ви вот пригласили девушеку от 18 до 30 лет не боитесь.. Арах чего боюся, во первих  ем, я не постесняюся паспорт посмотреть и свій покажу… штоб без обид… тем болеє, никто насильно, заставлять, што либо, не собирається… даже што ти не делай не прикопаєшся…. В лутшем случає, за порно, в не положеном местє впоймают…  где нибуть на берегу реки… к примеру… просьба также не приходить девушек, у котрих єсть парень, или они замужем….  Девушкам в котрих уже єсть дети, но они свободи, вобщем, єсли хотите, приходитє, там розберемся… Доктор вообще дурний….   Арах когда подкативал к девушкам, сама коротка отмазка, што я бедний, так што я скажу так, лучше попитатся стать багатим идиотом, чем бить бедним умником…  Доктор в вас комплекс не полноцености… от бедности…. Скоко зарплата? Арах мало… около 1 тисячи…. Доктор штоб било більше встройтеся на четире роботи одновременно… Арах а ето как?.... Доктор смотрите идете работать сутки через троє, охранять фабрику и так далее, тесть сутки отдежурили на первом, сутки на втором, сутки на третем, сутки на четвертом, снова сутки на первом, сутки на втором и так далее… Арах доктор, а ви лечится не пробивали, у вас с головой не все впорядке, при таком графике, ви долго не видержите…. Да и на семю, вас точно времени не будет… Доктор дзвените меня но многиє имено так и работают… мне вот інтересно што же ви не сказали нащет отдихать когда, а сразу на семю послалися….    Арах ну ету схему, што ви сказали, я знаю, но я би, согласился на нее, єслиби поєхал, на заробітки в москву, но не дома, в таком вариантє, в москвє, не нада квартиру снимать…. Работаєш на четирех работах… сутки работаєш, чуток поспал, єще сутки работаєш, чуток поспал… и так далее, ну смотритє, в москвє там скоко зарплата 20 тисяч рублей… или більше… то єсть за месяц на четирех работах, до 100тисяч рублей, и квартиру, снимать не нада…. Вот так за пол. Года, люди заробатуют пол. Милиона рускими… што в гривнах, 100-200тисяч гривен, за 6 месяцев… а ви доктор, сдеся, предлагаєте так работать и получить до 20 тисяч, точно у вас штото не впорядке…. Так работают, токо там где хорошо плотят, в таком графике, вам не будет, времени на семю… Доктор у вас точно не все хорошо с головой, што же ви так не делаєтє…. Арах доктор проблема в том, што я могу, начать заробативать, фантазіями, а не тяжовим, физическим трудом, и теоретично, даже в 100раз більше, за 6 месяцев, чем єсли, би я начал на четирех работах пахать, как собака бешена….    Доктор на фантазіях не заработаєш… Арах доктор, на фантазіях можно, свободо, заробативать, от двух тисяч гривен в месяц, што даже більше, чем от работи фізично, по большом счету… Доктор с чево ви взяли што ви так сможете… Арах а с того, што сечас, я делаю, перший пробний екземпляр, такого произведения… Доктор а как ви будете, просить, видавцов видать, вашу перву, книгу… Арах я по вашому идиот??... просить видавцов, видать перву книгу… Орел наверно да…. Ведь так всегда долається, я серєзно… Арах согласен… но времени для роскачки востребованости, нет, поетому, старт, на підстопе, с ультра-турбо-интелектуальним, ускорителем процеса… Лев ето как… Арах попитатся зафигачить хит года… в етой номинации, котрий, в мире по популярности, и скорости, роспространения, будет соизмерим, из хитом песней ой секси лейди, оп оп опа гамнастайл…. Лев не вийдет…. Арах да ето, гадалка, на двоє гадала, а может и вийдет… Орел и скоко ти єго уже пишеш… Арах из 5марта 2015года…. Трачу на ето 10-15% свобідного времени, а што… Орел не гони…. Беса… ниче в тебя не видет, я как тот шайтан, об етом говорю, с етого ниче не вийдет… Арах да ладно вам… ви же не серйозно… Орел впоєне серйозно…    Доктор ви хотите об етом поговорить? Орел хоть ти заткнися…. Арах представте себе, дом своєй мечти… Орел што…. Издеваєшся… ти лучше роскажи, што знаєш о вселенной… Арах как ви щитаєтє бог єсть? Орел раз верим, знач єсть… Арах с одной сторони ви прави.. вера ето тоже бог…. Но я болем чем уверен… што бог єсть, скажу болєє того он єдиний, он один для всех   и для нас… и для інопланетян… Орел офигел? Ти че несеш.. в мусульман свій, в нас свій, в інопланетян ще інший….  Лев чердак єдет, у тебя….. Арах за скоко бог по преданиям создал землю…. Лев за сем дней…. А потом стал смотреть на плоди своєй роботи… Арах скажите, скоко ви можете видержать, штоб ничего не делать, єсли бог ідеал, то он точно, не бездельник, скоко прошло со времени создания земли… милиарди лет? Представте себя, на его месте, вот ви создали землю, и все сидите и токо смотрите…. А разве не возникнет желаниє, сделать єще такую землю, и человека, по образу и подобию, своєму…. Орел што за хуйню ти несеш…     Арах виходит така штука господа… што єсли внимательно, рамотреть из сторони сристианства, и бог существуєт, а єсть причини, считать, што и в прямь существуєт, при том, што он ідеал… он явно не лентяй, а значит он точно не остановился токо на нашей планетє, и со сторони християнства, випливаєт… какраз момент, што инопланетянє, скорее всего существуют, и бог создав нашу землю…. Начал содавать, подобниє земли….  Лев ти что несеш, християнство, утверждаєт по твоєму што инопланетяне существуют…. Арах я намекаю што бог єдиний для всех и нашей планети и других планет… Орел вообще, ти охуєл… Арах што такоє релігія, как ви щитаєтє…. Орел єдино правильноє, знаниє о боге… Арах ви точно уверенни, што ето так… Орел ето гарантия… Арах ви ошиблись… Орел президент росии, никогда не ошибаєтся, он всегда прав… Арах я с вами согласен, в вашем утверждении частино, да существуєт правило, прав тот, у кого більше прав… Бог єдиний … но когда он даєт знания пророкам, они начинают, в ето дело, вставлять и свій пістон… тобто, бог дав одне, кодекс законов, как должен жить человек, а вот человек, записивавший слово боже, не всегда, єго верно записи вал… в итогє и возникают, раз ниє религии… Лев не чуди людей…. Ти, беса гониш… херню несеш….    Арах давайте так сказж, вот сечас, я 5 человекам, скажу одно и тоже, и пусть они, через нєделю ето дело запишут…. Моє мнениє,  там окажется п’ять разних росказов… Орел вобще очумел, ето как…. Арах допустим… я вам навтикал, страниц 10 текста читая… ви заповнили, суть… но уви когда ви будете, ето записивать через время, ви забудете, не нарошно, часть етого текста… потому… ви, помня суть текста…. Запишитє, по своєму… а вот третий человек, котрий не знал што за текст бил сначала, прочитаєт, ето дело… и оно может бить Орел што ти несеш… Арах што ми знаєм о боге… он духовноє созданиє… духовне созданиє, не имеет тела… а значит в єго возможностях, создавать енергетичне влияниє, для создания временного тела…. Лев психиатров єму… Арах успокойтесь, дишите глибоко, считая до 100, пока не успокоитесь…. Орел трандец…. Арах ето значит што раз бог, не создавая физичноє тело, должен дать, знаниє, закони жизни…. Через посередника, способного его слишать, а уже посередник… росказиваєт…. Но ето, как испорчений телефон… суть останется неизменной, а вот слова, будут разни, со временем, пойдет росхождениє из суттю….так образуются, раз ниє религии, но духовне створіння, давше знання, одно для всех, но в итоге, все религии разниє….    Лево доктор помогитє мне…. В меня от его чуши, чердак сєжаєт… Орел   то єсть бог не может, сам розказати всем?? Арах єсли принимать, во вниманиє, библию, он может, послать, ребенка святого духа, к примеру Исуса Христа… Орел а сам, он, то не может… Арах ну почему, ви вперлися, што он сам не может, бог всемогучий, и может все…. В том числе, и сам воплотится в плоть.. Орел а почему тогда так много бед…. Вот бог, мог би их все остановить…. Арах все началося, из древа познания, добра и зла… Орел а древо познания к чему… Арах бог гарантировал, што пока, человек, не захочет познать все, сожрав яблуко, с древа познаия добра и зла… он будет делать так, штоб зла не било…. Токо добро… Орел то єсть, за всеми попку подтирал….    Арах в неком смисле, да… на самом деле, делал все штоб било токо добро… а вот когда они сожрали яблуко, адам и єва, бог им намекнул, вива ет валити… иди вали отваливай… то єсть, захотіли знать все, я не могу вам запретить, знайте не токо добро, а знайте и зло… и от человека зависит, токо от него, што он несет, добро, или зло… то єсть  што єсть, человек ребенок бога, сначала, он нянчил и опекла, человечєство, от всех бед и нєвзгод, до тех. Пор, пока человечєство, не сказало єму, папаша, а ведь ми уже взрослиє, и готови сами, все рєшать… Лев да не било там такого… Арах как я говорил, слова меняют люди, но суть остається, той же… они не говорили словами, што они готови сами все решать, они ето сказали, поступком…. Орел догнал, ми хотим все решать, все познать, и по етом, ми как тот вредитель, плодожерка ненаситная, сєдаєм плоди з древа познания, добра и зла… Лев так сечас же люди нє, єдят яблук познания, слушай, а может и єдят, ми ведь єдим яблука….. может нам от них отказатся….. Арах и не познаєт человек, добра и зла до тех. Пор, пока впервиє, не сожрет яблуко…. Орел правильно, детям не давати… яблука єсть… Лево смисл в том, што пока перший человек не сєл яблуко, а вот отдуватся, за єво грех, и єму пришлося…. И всем єво нащадкам… и ми уже в свою очередь, за етот грех отдуваємся, арах ти считаєш в чем дело, в яблуке…. Арах не яблуко само по себе самий обичний плод…. А вот бог, запре тил єво єсть, когда человек не послушал бога, он пошол против єво воли…. А соответственно, он показал… што он вибираєт судьбу…. Сам…    Лево ведь бог даєт человеку судьбу, и токо он, может занать што будет.. Арах вобщем все правильно, так и єсть…. Бог знаєт, што будет…. А наши гадалки и екстрасенси, питаються, узнать што будет, от часточки бога в своєй душе, на самом деле бог не создал человека, подобним себе, по внешнем признаку, он єво создал, подобним себе, по внутренем, духовном признаку, человек способен мислить, решать сам и так далеке, никто не знаєт на самом деле, как он виглядит… он способен принимать любой облик, какой он хочет…. Лево кто такому учит…. Орераторка канала росия 24 я щас в обморок упаду…. Орел а вот когда бог создал наш мир, он ведь говорил… Арах ага и сказал бог да будет свет, котрий будет чередоватся с солнцем… и так далеке… све што он не сказал исполнялося, ви хоть представляєте, што произойдет, єсли он заговорит в истинном подоби, сразу все его слова, начнут исполнятся…. Поетому, он и не говорит с человеком в истинном виде… а лиш передавая знания через других, или воплощаясь, в смертноє тело… в таком случає, сили в єго слов будет на много менше…. Орел офигел?....     Арах представим себе…. В истином своєм значении бог говорит и енергія слов проходит сквозь канал раз мером у вселеную… а она безгранична… то єсть енергія слов не имеет граници… а вот, когда он, принимаєт облик биологичного существа, в нашем случає человека, канал сквозь котрий проходит, енергія, єво слов, очень и очень ограничен… а ето значит што сила у слов в бесконечность раз менше….. вот почему бог и принял облик Исуса Христа, или же исус, бил сином бога, в существенном, всемирном плане ето не имеет, существенной разници…. Ибо Исус Христос бил частичкой, святого духа…. И нес знания святого духа…    тепло насосна електростанція… цю я ще не описував… не волнуйтеся дальше єще будет теорія как из свинца -золото получать, а из урана -торий… … Леонид с котрим, я обсуждал ету установку, сказал што она может не заработать, по причине, што напряжениє, видаваємоє, термопарами малоє, но идея интересная… итак идея состояла в том, што єсть термопари… коториє, в електрику, переводять 1-3% от тепла, но оказиваєтся єсть термопари, переводящиє в електрику, 5-10% тепла, такиє термопари називаються полупроводниковими, работают в диапазоне температур, -20 до +70 градусов цельсия и кстати, ето саме то, што нужно, для моєй установки из фантазии, именно такиє в фантазии и присутствовали… хотя они и дорогиє… Итак теорія єсли тепловой насос снимаєт, довільно більшу разность температур, в теории можно сделать, тепловой насос перекачивающий, 20-35 квт тепла, за счет одного киловата електроенергии… то єсть, в теории ми можем за сет одного киловата, електрики, забрать тепла 35квт из одной ємкости…. И передать их во втору ємкость…. А между ємкостями, разместить термопари, сквозь коториє, тепло будет ити из ємкости котору ми нагрели, в ємкость, каку ми охладили… как виполнени ємкости…. Ємкость, котору ми грецем, являється трубой, діаметром 10метров или більше….. длиной 200метров или більше…. Вся поверхность труби, покрита, полупроводниковими термопарами……. Даная труба…. Вставлена в трубу длини на 10 метров дольше, а по діаметру в полтора раза большую…. То єсть длини 210метров….и діаметра 15 метров….. Внутреню ємкость, делаєм герметичной, и тепло она теряєт, токо через термопари…  скоко слоїв термопар…. Я как наглий дурак, предлагаю попитатся ставить, 20 слоєв, полупроводникових термопар… мало ли получится… из сбором тепла в виде електрики 5-10%.... в теории такиє термопари снимут 20 раз по 5-10% от тепла, проходящего, в виде електроенергии… тога… логічно допустить…. Єсли получится… што сквозь термопару пройдет 90-95%тепла…. То єсть следуща термопара уже их используєт как свои 100% прошедших сквозь нее, и снова, пройдет  90-95% тепла…., то єсть карда термопара жрет по 5-10%. В итоге количество тепла пропущеноє термопарами будет 0.95 в степени 20 или 0.9в степени 20…. То єсть сквозь термопару пройдет лиш 20-40% тепла…. Остача превратится в дробленоє електричество…. Предупреждаю сразу последовательно, термопару, соєденять нельзя…. Поетому к ней нада парисоєденить котушку….трансформатора, и конденсатор, меж виходами из термопари, перед котушко й поставить транзистор…. На котрий ми подаєм сигнал управления… Лево я физику учил нигада там в тебя не вийдет…. Арах на самом деле существуєт вариант номер два… а он уже 100 єво целая команда расматривала…. Из етих термопар заряжать акумулятори… дающиє напряжениє… 0.1 вольта….и даже акумулятори дающиє0.01 вольт можно собирать вродє, нада таблицу електропотенциалов, металов смотрєть.. Орел бред таких акумуляторов не существуєт… Арах их не существуєт по тому, што в них нет смисла…. А вот при сборе микронапряжений, в них єсть смисл…. Лев да ну нафиг… акумулятори по 0.1 вольт они дорогиє… лучше те што по 24 вольта….сразу дают… Арах смішно а знаєте ли ви што єденичного акумулятора дающего болем 4-5 вольт существовать не может…. Орел не порошенко прав, лучше акумулятори на 24 вольта…. Арах вольтаж акумулятора, прямолинейно зависит от разности потенциалов металов, акумулятора…. Обачно используют…. Більшу разность….. але в нашем случає, нада подоб рать акумулятори с минимальним напряженим, когда ми их заряжаєм от установки…. Ми их переводим в режим паралельних акумуляторов….. то єсть все они заряжаются паралельно…… а вот когда ми хотим потребить переводим автоматикой в последовательний режим…. То єсть заряжаєм как 0.1 вольтовиє, а используєм, как последовательний например на 450вольт…. То єсть 4500 штук сразу….    Орел якаж тебе, блядь, цьому навчила… Арах люди научили, с КГБ, им неяким хуєм, послє распада союза, било занятся… Орел да ну нахуй… такого не биваєт… Арах Пусть появится професор физики…. Арах професор нарисуйся….  Професор я телепортировался… в меня вишло…. Орел гадон у тебя получился, а не процес телепортации… Професор я ведь телепортировался…. Лев тебя телепортировали в сказку… твоя кофемолка, в лаборатории не рабочяя….. Професор произошол процес розложения на квантовиє частици… и перенос… в другоє место….    Арах а знаєте ли ви професор… штоб призвести телепортацию сквозь субквантовий коридор…. Не обходимо первує… получит ваше днк…. Перевести єго в цифрову форму…. Дальше отследить все ваши біоритми… перевести их в електронну форму….. то єсть создать вашу електронную копию….. передать вашу електронну копию на второй апарат телепортации…. И когда перший апарат будет вас… розбирать на атоми….. второй апарат….. должен вас собирать на втором конце из атомов…. Штото на подоби субатомного ксерокса…. В одном местє ви розпадаєтесь…. Во втором образовиваєтесь….. при етом ви теряєте всю свою пам'ять, начиная с процеса  вашого полного сканирования когда все ваши знания, весь ви… били превращени в електрону копию…. После чего вас розложили на атоми, и передали…. Атомами… в другой телепорт…. Котрий вас там собрал…. После сканирования и до сбора на втором телепорте… ви ничего не помнитє….. очень удобно, єсли хочеш комуто стереть пам'ять….    Доктор што за експерименти, на людях, ви здеся проводитє…. Цикало професор ви попали… хи хи…. Професор меня инопланетянє похитили, на помощ, караул… счас меня в чудо-юдо превратят…. Он уже копию орла, льва и других людей сделали, сечас и меня клонируют…. Арах професор, у вас и так чердак єдет… успокойтеся…. Давайте поговорим о физике…. Професор а какже вот телепортация в одежде… Арах токо идиоти. Способни телепортируватся в одежде, вас же второй телепорт соберет в одежде…. Професор вот ето правильно…. Арх. Нигада не правильно,  у вас вместо кожи, может оказатися одежда… наши на земле никогда не телепортируются, токо коридори…    Провесор што за коридори…. Арах в паралельном измерении летаеє сверхскоросной самолет…. Вертикального взлета….. в точке где он принимаєт «пасажира» он садится…. Откриваєт проход… меж мирами….  Человек преодолеваєт етот проход… попадая с етого мира в другой, там он летит етим самолетом, в точку назначения, опять откриваєтся проход, тело вилазит в етот мир и вуаля…. Так можно незаметно, перебратися с києва в москву… или на оборот… Професор откуда знаєш….. Арах скажем так, слишал…. Орел я о таком не слишал…. И кака скорость в самолета? Арах 5-7 км за секунду верхний предел…. Атомний турболет… для ускорения используєт перегрітий пар…. Єго називают по другом «модуль»…. Прикольня хрень… бистрее стелса будет…. Лев блять… такоє не реально…. Арах реально, какраз реально… просто привод не простой у реактивной турбини…. Лев да єсли и золотой не реально…     Арах во первих не золотой а електромагнітний…. Турбина… ето гигантский електродвигатель….. в котором в добавку…. И атомний реактор вмонтирован, для подогрева воздуха…. Діаметр турбини всасивания 3метра … а длина 25 метров….. виход турбини, виталкивающий воздух діаметр 8метров…. В переди стоит лопасть втягующа воздух….. сзади лопасть вращающаяся при виталкивании воздуха….. в самолєта поши…. 200 таких турбин…. По сути ем как вам сказать ето летающий космічний крейсер…. Єсли он появится в нашем мире, он горя наделаєт не мало…. Професор не понял што за турбини, нафиг, таких не биваєт… Арах щас об’ясню… турбина являється видоизмененим елетродвигателем, многофазним…. Скажем так 200фаз….. на подачу електрики…. Електроидвигателю…. Идет постоялий ток и напряжения по на самом двигателе, стоит центральний процесор, преобразования електроенергии, дающий двести фазних сигналов, коториє, подаються, на усилители сигнала, в результате чего, постоянний електроток, превращаєтся в фазний переменний… и на кажду скажем так, котушку, в итоге собственная фаза…. То єсть само питаниє, постоянок, в сам електродвижок, вмонтирован преобразователь…. То єсть фигня в том што такой движок может бить запитан одновременно от 200 источников питания…. Професор не понял…. Как ето 200 источников питания….. ведь в нас используют 3 фазний….. Арах ми знаєм, как создать електродвигатель мощностю в пару трилионов тереват…..    Орел професор в обмороке, што с ним…. Арах его вставило…. Путин от чего? Арах АЕС на 10 турбинах видаєт к примеру с каждой по 300-800мегават… он представил движок жерущий сразу пару трилионов терават…. Лев и што?..... Арах єго можно кстати, использовать как преобразователь…. Кпд привода 70% кпд генератора 70%, к примеру… кпд преобразования к примеру…. Будет 50% но при етом он соберет енергію….. 2трилионов АЕС, в одном приводящем ел двигателе, и видаст половину етой енергии на генераторє…. Орел нафига….. Арах допустим єсли нам нада сделать так називаємо молнию… високой мощности и так далее…. Вобщем така методика, позволяєт, делать електродвигатели…. Имеющиє трилиони источников питания… с помощю усилите лей преобразовивая сигнал, в нужну фазу, а на генераторє, виходит собраний сигнал…. Професор…. Ето точно инопланетниє технологи, на земле их нет… где ти их взял…    Арах я взиваю, ко всем інопланетним кораблям, читаючим ето посланиє, прибудьте на ету планету…. Помогитє остановить ету войну….. нам нужно сотрудничество с вами, наша страна может предложить, туризм, для ваших граждан… из сна я понимаю, вас такоє интересуєт, и раз ниє сувеніри, а также предмети искуства, а также начать производство комедій лично для вас, у вас, в святи, с переизбитком технологічного прогреса… началися проблеми, из культурной составляющей, которую, ви восполняєтє, путем наблюдения, за цивилизациями, коториє слабо развитиє….. такиє как наша….. для вас наша цивилизация, по уровню, техничного развития, напоминаєт вам соотношениє подобности ваша- наша=наша-камений век…    Професор токо меня не питайте, пожалуйсто…. (жалобним голосочком)…. Арах професор скажитє а термопари какоє напряжениє, видают…. Професор маленькоє… 0.2-0.7вольта…. а што…. Арах а можно их собирать…. В одно большоє…. Професор можно но ето проблематично, транзистор потребляєт 0.1-0.2 вольта…. Арах а вот єсли сразу на акумулятор 0.1 вольта, можно? Професор таких нє випускают, но они возможни…. Их нет смисла випускать они очень малоє напряжениє собирают…. Но єсли добивать електрику термопарами, лутше от них не придумаєш… ето все знают… Арах а возможно ли имея тепловой насос, с 1 квта електрики, дающий 35 квт тепла, за сет перекачивания тепла… добивать електрику…. Професор обачно 1-2% в термопари кпд, но ето не относится до полупроводникових… там кпд от 4 до 10% и даже слишал, новиє появилися 50%.... Арах, может я подскажу как ети 50% работают….. Професор етого не розглашают… розказуй…. Арах ета термопара, являється термопарним чипом, товщини 0.1мм, составляєм… в етом 0.1 мм подряд 100 термопар…. Виходит етот термопарний чип имеет 200 виходов…. По два на кажду термопару… Професор как вариант… последовательно их собирать нельзя, в лучшем случає паралельно, на и то через трансформатор…. Но перед етим преобразовать в перемінку… Арах и с каждого вихода…. Идет на акумулятор малого напряжения…. Професор да в таком случає переменного напряжения не нада…. И падения напряжения, не произойдет…. Ето вариант…. Што же ето виходит термопарний микрочип, превращаєт 50% тепла в електрику…. Заряжаєт низковольтниє акумулятори…. Термопарна тец виходит…. Акумуляторний переход даст кпд процеса 40-50% не више…. Єсли собирали 35квт тепла 50% из них ето 17.5квт електрики потеря на акумуляторах 60%, значит в виде електрики на потреблениє 7квт електрики котору електроника преобразуєт в перемінку с кпд 90% итого ефективниє 6квт електрики… из них 1 квт електрики на запуск процеса… а 5 квт на потреблениє там где нам нада… інтересно девки пляшут…. Арах верно ведь виходит…. Токо успівай тепло, из внє качать…     Професор ЕВРИКА, я понял, ти ведь качаєш тепло земли, ти не потребляєш енергоносителей… ти просто как енергоноситель взял землю…. Забираєш с нее тепло…. Превращаєш єє в електрику…. Єсли украина создаст такиє установки… обичного типа тец исчезнут… по скоку такого типа тец, будет куда вигоднее, ти єє построил, и никогда не тратиш деньги на покупку угля, а постоянно перекачиваєш тепло… из одного места в другоє, доберая недостачу, из внешней среди…. Ето как вечний двигатель, но работать будет 100%, поскоку здесь нет никакой вечной енергии, а только ефективноє преобразованиє, в тепловой в електричество… с помощю термопар… то єсть он расходуєт теплову енергію, окружающей среди… превращая єє в електричество… из определеним кпд…. А не потребленная енергія, или неефективно забраная поять превратится в тепло в основном…. Значит ето то што нам нада, ви с академиєй наук не питалися связатся? Арах питался… ответ интересен… их видете ли, правительство, во все щели отимеет, поскоку запрещено вводить технологи, способниє, заменить нефть, уголь и газ…. И тем боліє поощрять такиє идеи…. Должни роз’яснять всем, єсли інститути физики, в такоє не верят, то ето именно так, а не как иначє… Професор  я смотрю ви мутний тип, походу им пришол пиздец..    Арах не знаю как академии наук, а вот одному професору физики в моєм городе… возможно и в правду жопа… из института физики… он сказал што все што человек мог изобрести, уже изобретено и більше ничего не возможно изобрести, и он ниє не станєт проверять… а єсли што не устраюєт… ображайтесь в СБУ, академію наук, или президенту украини…. Они вам тоже самоє скажут…. Професор кажится ктото довякался….    Арах главний из Сум Лисенко… начальник города, сказал такиє вещи не для простих ушей… их не дадут ввести… пока єсть уголь, нефть и газ… Арах кстати по роялті…. Из фантазий… росия может его использовать токо на улутшениє благосостояния населения и ни на што другоєєє… за использованиє в воєноє дело… лишениє виплат на срок 10-25 лет…. Украина не может использовать на улутшениє благосостояния населения… єдинственноє русло, невоєнного назначения производства… а точнєєє различниє фабрики машин, електроники, и так далее, и никакого латания дир…. Сша может использовать вариант как украини так и росии на их усмотрениє… но третего варианта не дано… вариант украини…. Ето постоянок наращиваниє, високоточного, и дорогостоящего производства, конкурентноспособного, из лутшими производствами європи…. Постоялий рост ввп от 0.01до 20 % внутренего валового продукта, в виде валютного оборота… к примеру количество єдениц понижається, а вот прибиль ростет… Смійтеся идея така… росия роздаєт помощ своєму населению… украина им продаєт свои товари… получаєте ти деньги себе… єсли росия сможет населения втюхать свои товари… она как би потом сможет, «отмив» так деньги использовать, куда єй хочется… но по всем рас ходам из роялті все три государства, обязани вилаживать в интернет скоко, когда, и куда потрачено…. То єсть росия роздаєт деньги незахищеним слоям населения… при етом… єсли оказується што роздают защищеним, чиновника под. суд… сов ременем когда все незащищениє, станут защищеними…. Роздаєт всей средней верстве населения…. Потом когда средняя ланка стаєт багатой… самим бедним среди багатих…. И так далее к примеру пока все не станут милиардерами и равни по денежним средствам… боюся в итоге работать, никто не захочет, а всє будут токо покупать…. На самом деле етот вариант… штото типа превращения росии в наполовину розвалену страну… єсли розобратся….. дело в том што рабочий клас… он довольно бедний….. а вот єсли, сделать всех с достатком 100тищ доларов у год… они не станут работать за три тищи в год… по сути в росии с годами производства будут чахнуть… и исчезать и росия станет на всегда зависимой от украини которая им будет продавать очень качествену продукцію…    По поводу украини сначала в рост пойдет технология и производство, потом зарплати…. Средний урівень достатка в валюте будет в 10 раз ниже чем в росии… но єсть одно но…. Урівень жизни… будет фактично тем же, при етом занятость на производствах населения будет составлять до 90-100%..... при етом требования к производствам, максимально легкиє условия труда… то єсть по сути все рабочиє, управляют техникой, очень дорогостоящей, котора вместо них делаєт роботу…. Всякими станками роботами и так далее… в уборщиц специальниє уборочниє машини, и другоє спец оборудованиє для уборки… всяких пилососи и так далее… В грузчиков всякиє електрокари и так далее, в автослесарей фулл набор преднадлежностей… от естакад до различних подємников и так далее, и большинство етого оборудования украина обв’язана за роялті научится изготавливать сама, и строить заводи по производству етого оборудования… а росия и все остальниє, пусть покупают, єсли хотят такоє оборудованиє в украини…. В итоге украина станет через сотни лет, государством с бюджетом как у всем остальном мире, за исключениєм США…. То єсть бюджет украини… будет равен бюджету всего остального сира минус бюджет США… теоретически ето так…. Почему исключая сша, а они будут такими самими… если деньги в развития производств пустят… бюджет всего мира за исключениєм бюджета украини…. А тепер представим, єсли украина станете ним штатом США или на оборот США войдет в состав украини….. боюся росии скоро придерся думать как стать автономной республикой в составе украини…. Не за 10-20 лет но за сотни лет росия станет украинской автономиєй типа крима, в составе украини, хотя фактично он в росии, официально, в украини… и будет в нас общий президент и парламент.. токо будет украина и автономная росия… а не росия и автономна республіка украина… хотя на самом деле будет, какраз то государство… обєденениє двух государств о каком мечтаєт Путин…     Орел чего, я мечтаю, штоб украина вошла в состав росии, а не росия в состав украини… Арах господин президент слишали такоє понятиє, от перестановки доданков, сумма не меняєтся….што так украинско-росийскоє государство, што росийско-украинскоє государство… всє должно бить, токо путєм референдума…. Орел вобще лутше, штоб украина вошла в росию…    Арах …. Пока американци мечтают, о людях в черном…. Кгб из 1954 года активно используєт костюми для исчезновения, правда ето тайна, хи хи… он виглядять как куча антен, и всякиє шлеми, начинают передаватся ел магнитниє волни, и человек исчезаєт. О их знаєт, около половини населения СССР, просто в основном по наслишке от других…. Очень активно, ими пользовалися с 1960-1989года… принимая за інопланетян…. Вот интересен бил случай в москве…. Такого клоуна, запечалили… на болеє 400 фотографиях, и 67 кинокамерах вроде в 1986 году… тога все камери конфисковали фотики тоже, а всех присутствующих, заставили подписать о не розглашении…. Орел млять, куда спецслужби смотрят, откуда информация… Арах бувше кгб слило… Лев нафига… не понимаю… Арах сам не знаю што езвесно об етих костюмах, первує они излучают електромагнитниє волни, второє радиацию…. Я когда перший раз услишал, сказал ого я хочу себе костюм невидимку… а «алиса» в ответ, жить надоїло?... и начала росказивать о нем от етого костюма, погибло около 200тисяч человек, испитивавших ети костюми, не один человек, одевавший его хот раз, не прожил боліє трех лет, в етом костюме бил его изобретатель, он прожил, после одевания три дня… дальше костюм совершенствовали, но люди одевающиє его, смертники, уже на етапе, што они им воспользуются один раз…. Лев значить там страшниє излучения и он не может бить нє видимим… Арах фишка в том, што он действительно не видимий и єго не возможно обнатужить… но в то время как в нас он не видим, в суб пространстве, он излучаєт радиацию, 300-500 микроренген в час как минимум…. А в нашем мире вобще не показуєт радиацию… ето говорит о том, што костюм, фізично уходит в иной мир, с котрого видно, што происходит в нашем, в меня мурашки по коже… услишав об етом костюме, я понял, што таке возможно, правда… правда цена такой не видимости… сдохнеш и очень бистро, нужна хорошая защита, не токо от ел магн злучений, а и от радиации… Орел перший прожил три дня, а как тогда некоториє, прожили по три года… Арах Слишали о так називаємих примочках используємих при облучении радиациєй, плюс уменшениє облучения… и так даліє, вобщем на 1987 год человек попавший один раз в костюм, на пару часов, проживал после етого, полтора два года…. Такова цена невидимости…    Орел да скем угодно можно договорится… токо нада соблюдать мои условия…. Арах ем а єсли ваши условия не устраюют… Орел меня ето не интересуєт…. Арах вот видитє говоритє правду, не скривая…. Может бить, нужни условия, интересни и вам и нам, ну не биваєт так, штоб не могла бить какогото варианта, не заинтересовавшего, вас більше, чем ваши условия…. Орел анука нука… подробнєєє, аж інтересно стало… Арах вам не нравится што украина не в составе росии, давайте предложим референдум в украине и в росиє, так по закону будет верно… росяне проголосуют за обєденениє с украиной, но украинци с росиєй нет, и ви об етом знаєте, а причина в самой агресии, єслиби, єє небило, а визначально, бил предложен, мирний вариант, через референдум, возможно, слияниє и произошло би… а вот вся ета фигня из анексиєй привела к тому што все не приємлют, влияния в росию…    Орел ну ти и водовар, я ето и так знаю…. А єсли захватить? Што будет… Арах наверно гражданська война в росии… между росиянами… теми кто вас подерживают и теми, што нє подерживают…. Орел не ходи вокруг да около, как кот учений, на дубе том…. По котором, ходит по цепи кругом, в сказкє пушкина… Лев хи хи хи…. Арах смотрите ми иследовали росию, на територии росии обнатужили три поселка… с населеним боліє 20 человек, коториє на 2014 год думали, што они живут в СССР, и не могли поверить, когда им об’ясняли, што в росии, а не ссср живут… на самом делє, ето не удивительно… Орел чего…. Арах провертє дальний восток, в большинстве поселков, чиновников небило на протяжении п’яти лет… они не знают, што там происходит… єсть поселки где не ступала нога чиновника, 10-15 лет…. Ну и три поселка удивили… они думали што в СССР живут…. Рождаєтся вивод…. Скоко же людей участвуєт в виборах президента, не в обиду…    Орел от сволочи, нафига… ету информацию казать… Арах украинци, должни набратися терпения, и начать спасать росию… Орел обалдел…. Арах слушайте может вас заинтересуєт алхимия, как добивать золото из свинца, теорія…. Орел ето не возможно, но інтересно послушать, фальшивоє золото делают постоянко….    Арах проблема в том што настоящеє…. Щас об’ясню в чем дело…. Дело в том што ядро свинца, имеет на один протон, більше, чем ядро золота…. И когда, ми умикнем, из ядра один протон, свинец превратится в золото…. Ето термоядерна фізика висшего ранга, фізика антиматерии… дело в том што сам по себе, свинец, не склонен, к термоядерном распаду…. И хорошо поглощаєт радиацию…. Так вот суть в том што даже матеріал, или елемент, не способний к роспаду, можно рас щепить, создав в определених условиях, созданиє протонов и антипротонов…. Антипротони существуют тисячниє секунди после образования, а дальше самоуничтожаются, встретившись с протонами… Лев чего… так нигада не вийдет образовалися и сразу исчезли… Арах не согласен…. Протон имеет заряд плюс, а антипротон заряд минус…. То єсть заряд антипротона, такой самий как и у електрона…. То єсть єсли у вакуме, где образуются протони и антипротони…. Просипать позитивнозаряжениє атоми свинца, они будут к себе притягивать електрони… но допустим, уви в нас оказуються токо протони и антиротони…. Антипротон имеет заряд как в електрона, и если на протяжении доли секунди существования, к нему случаймо, позитивно заряжений атом свинца, окжется ближе, чем протон, то антипротон попитається заменить електрон атома, но уви, изза очень большой маси, он попадет прямо в ядро свинца, и соеденится с протоном ядра, исчезнет протон и антипротон, в атоме свинца, структура, ядра начнет перестраиватся, при етом есть одно вселенскоє правило…. Чем више атомна маса материала, тем більше енергии в меж протоном соєдинении скрито… то єсть при превращении свинца в золото, начнет виделятся атомная енергія… на самом деле, так можно в теории превращать уран в торий, и пошло поєхало…. К примеру добивать иридий…. Один грам иридия стоит 5 тисяч доларов, єсли я правильно слишал, без него, нельзя запустить ракети в космос, но он чрезвичайно рєдкий…. Его очень мало… и залежами иридия, считаєтся руда, в которой иридия 0.01%, то єсть єго дорого добивать… а єсли научится превращать атоми с большей атомной масой, в атоми с меншей атомной масой…. Можно получать и атомну енергію, да еще и нужний нам матеріал, котрий редко встречаєтся…. Просто нада научится делать толкову установку, создающу с огромной вероятностю, античастици…. И сквозь них, просипать… атоми, одног материала, позитивно заряженого…. И превращать один атом, в атом на порядок ниже… с виделениєм атомной енергии…. Орел а вот єсли я хочу синтезировать из большей масой, ага… вот скажи… Арах в теории тоже возможно, но на практике нада колосальне давлениє и температуру, штоб усложнить масу… почему, она и виделяєтся при атомном распадє в итоге…     Орел ти єще об’ясни как построить атомний реактор на водородє, для полного счастья, ато процес распада водовода, не остановить… Арах ну да єсть… теорія така, раз нельзя остановить водородний розпад, значит нада учится, акамулировать ету енергію…. И ето возможно… Орел да ну нафиг….. Арах єє можно акамулировать с помощю води, под. колосальним давленим, нагревая воду в акумуляторе до 600-800 градусов цельсия, и используя перегретую воду етой температури, для нагрева води до 400градусов цельсия…. То єсть теорія така…. Создаєм две сферисниє ємкости теплоакамулятора, нижняя діаметр… до 1км…. Верхняя діаметр до 500метров…. И такиє штоб видержали, при температуре 1000градусов, давлениє свише 300атмосфер….нижняя ємкость соєденена из реактором, и одновременно с етим, соєденена с потребителем…., а вот верхняя являється расширительним бачком над нижнєй…. Когда ми заполняєм систему, ми заливаєм єє водой, штоб били заполнени абсолютно все пори… но в процесе нагрева, давлениє кастет и вода начинаєт спаряться… наша задача спроектировать так, штоб все бульбашки пара, уходили в верхний расширительний бачок, при етом освободившееся место под. силой тяж ести заменит вода в низу, то єсть чем више температура, тем давлениє будет полишаться… за сет верхнего расширительного бачка єсли он нагрелся до 1 тисячи градусов и хорошо термоизолирован, температура будет сохранятся, даже єсли в нижнем в процесє теплообмена…  она упадет до 400 градусов, то єсть давлениє системи останется тем же…. На самом делє ето полезноє свойство, позволяющее удерживать постояноє давлениє, при том што ми греем воду, до 800-900градусов, а потом используєм, как источник тепла… охлаждая до 400 градусов цельсия… Лев слиш те сказали ядерний распад водовода не остановить…. Арах правильно распад не остановить, но использовав определеноє количество водорода, для распада… енергію термоядерного распада, можно накопить, в термоакумуляторє, а потом, накоплену в акумуляторе енергію, использовать, для роботи тец….     Орел єбать, ви достали, решили енергетику наєбнуть? Арах да ладно вам… в нас в украине кризис, в меня нет вибора, токо вводить, рослабтеся, и получайте удовольствиє, вам ведь, дали процент от роялті на идеии, может бить, он сможет компенсировать ваши потери… тем болеє, переход на ети источники, процес не одного года, а десятков лет… или більше… а к тому времени и енергоресурсов, в мире, станет значительно менше, всему своє время… тем боліє когда пойдет процес, к постройте космічного флота, ресурси, томливо, в итоге придерся добивать, переработкой растительних решток, в топливо…. Один взлет 200 космичних кораблей на земле, приведет к сжиранию, количества топлива, потребляємого сечас планетою… сечас, за 10лет… так как корабли весом около 200млн тон каждий… то єсть для взлета полетов и посадки…, кораблю нада по 180 млн тон топлива…. Переведем в долари росходов на топливо…. Ето болем 180 млрдов литров цена около 30 доларов за литр… ето 5.4трилионов доларов… на топливо одном кораблю в год…. С одной сторони казалось би, никто их не станет делать, а с другой сторони….. какраз станут…. И сто процентов станут…. Один космічний корабль на орбите планети…. Дієт колосальноє воєноє преимущество… так как тактически, єго пошти не возможно сбить из земли…. Если в него хорошая система защити…. Он лазерами, сможет уничтожать, все ракети, летящиє на него, к примеру, или встречними ракетами, болем того, он будет на висоте 2-10тисяч км или болем… и его достать чем либо, будет трудно, при етом, используя атомниє реактори и солнечниє батареии он может ефективно атакувати наземниє цели, приетом, имея дзеркальну поверхность, из охлаждениєм, што делаєт, его мало уязвимим к лазерам… то єсть сбить ракетой трудно… лазер, пошти не действуєт, и в ето время кораблю помагаєт проводить атаки сила гравитации…   хи хи сто пудов начнется гонка вооружения, из постройки кораблей…. Как можно секономить, на запускє, космічного корабля, для етого, не обходимо, построить мощнейшую, електромагнитную рампу, способную, розогнать корабль, на виходе из рампи, до 5-10км за секунду, длина рампи около 400-1000км… ета рампа, позволит, запускать, 20 кораблей в год по той же расходной в топливе в год, што и для одного корабля, без рампи…. Рампа для взлета запитиваєтся около 200твт или більше, ел енергии в час…. К примеру на 100тисяч твт в час… процес взлета длится 15-30 секунд… по сути корабль вставляється у сверхмощний линей ний електродвигатель…. Где и пригодится, вот тот момент што я описи вал на кажду котушку, может бить собственний источник електропитания…. Орел ого идеи… зачем такоє вилаживать…    Лев идиот, што ти делаєш…. Арах я по вашом, похож на самоубийцу, котрий по приказу украини, наєбнет всех енергопостачальников, и не предложит им, куда можно сбивать енергоресурси… Орел о хитрая сволота…. Наєбнуть, дає ще так штоб у них небило убитков? Ти вобще скоко зайцев, питаєшся догнати, одним махом, 2, 3 или більше…. Вибирай шось одне а то не вийде зразу два…. Арах ем от одного зайца, можно копита откинуть…. Нада два три сразу, тут без вариантов…. Нельзя отоптать ноги, нефтегазовом заговору, как хочет украина, руками людей, а росхлебивать людям, а не тем кто придумал… поетому, нада сразу придумать систему, как сделать, штоб нефтегазовий заговор, не понес убитков, и вполнє, даже, заработал на етом, колосальниє деньги…. Орел ну зараза, я посмотрю, на то што ти предложиш…. Арах етап перший нефтегазовиє магнати первиє влаживают, в развитиє новой енергетики, за розработку и созданиє новой енергетики им виплачиваєтся вечноє суб роялті, к примеру, или обичноє роялті, на протяжении, к примеру… 50 лет… роялті может виплачиватся, как и за идею, єсли она ценная как и за сделаноє кето другим изобретениє, по етой ідеє, предлагаю, нефтегазовом заговору занять ету нишу… и собирать налоги, постоянко лиш за то, што сделали первую рабочую модель… сделали практичноє, а не теоретичноє изобретениє, а за теорію кусочок делится арах, сша, росии и украине… Лев што за хуйня, я такого єще не слишал… Арах второє, нефтєгазовий заговор, им рекомендація создавать так називаємоє, обагащеноє томливо, и продавать куда дороже чем обичноє… во первих… ето позволит економить, на транспортировке… зачеп вести 10 литров топлива, по цене 2 долара продавать, ести можно продать супер томливо 5 литров, по ценє 5 доларов…. Прибиль нє упадет…. Етап следущий, введениє, нових технологий… процес очень дорогостоящий, и полупроводниковая тец, на низьковольтних акумуляторах, вещь, очень дорогая…. В ближайшиє 5-10 лет ожидаєтся падениє, потребления класичних енерго ресурсов не боліє 1-5%, што в принципе допустимо, на мировом ринке….      Также рекомендую нефтегазовом заговору, вкладивать в розработку мультипроцесоров для компютеров…. Теорія виплила, из експеремента, мого друга … он из п’яти пентиумов вторих, сделал один пентиум третий…. Лев какой ти дурак, думаєш што ктото тронет, за то што привнес вечну енергію….. Арах я реаліст в даном случає, а ви фантазер, думая што никто не тронєт… Орел а парень пожалуй прав, и за меншиє изобретения, людей убивают, а за вечниє двигатели, и так даліє, подавно… хм єсли ето примха государства… ем а тут не докажеш…. Што ето єго затея…. Поскоку тактично, всє соблюдено… после введения кризиса, гос инстаниции, и так далее, обойти всє инстанции, а потом введєниє, по альтернативном плану, ем человек, сам в жизни не придумаєт, для такого нада иметь айкю в 10 раз више среднего… и думать, как сотня разних людей одновременно… и смотреть со всех возможних сторон… а на такоє, никто не способен… ем или супер гении или инопланетянє, способни сами, такоє придумать, обичний человек, нє придумаєт, ума не хватит… Арах или человеку помагают…. Не думали….    Орел может и так… тогда с масонами связан… те такиє што могут, придумать… Арах вернемся к комп’ютерам, стоитначать призводить, комп’ютери на 10-100терагерц тактовой частоти, за сет того, што они имеют 1тисячу-10 тисяч фізичних ядер…. Кажде ядро тактовой частоти 15ггц, с помощю адаптеров и програми, узгодження, системи, управления процесорами, можно создать, мультиядерний комп’ютер, из сумарной тактовой частотой 10 терагерц….  В режиме обработки информации как єдиноє ядро, кпд мультипроцесора 40-60% остача мощности процесора, узгодження процесов, обработки информации… то єсть для одного єдиного процеса… он как процесор на 4 тгц будет… а вот для тисячи процесов… по 8-9тгц на каждий процесор….. соответственно для такого комп’ютера оперативна, пам'ять… в 20-500терабайт…. Вінчестери на 500тисяч терабайт….  Єсли заклепать такиє компи они очень дорогиє…. В НТА комп’ютер телепортации, процесор на 10милиардов ядер, по 25ггерц кажде ядро… думаю остачу об’яснять не стоит 10 в 10степені терабайт оперативна пам'ять та 10 в 15степені терабайт вінчестери, якось так…. Точно не знаю… Орел блять как за 15 лет такоє можно создать….    Арах не волнуйтеся такими уже пользовалися 6.5тисяч лет назад, єще в древнем єгипте, так што рослабтєся… немножко истории єгиптянє, хорошо умели стрелять с електромагнітних гармат, строили пирамиди с бетона, летали на нло, строили бомбоубежища, строили електростанции, имели батарейки… стреляли с енергетического оружия… Лев ти што несеш, што за бред, зараза… Арах смотритє почему с бетона строили пирамиди, читал в 2003 году, переведениє манускрипти, с дрєвнєєгипетского… так вот там очень важним требованиєм к бетону била, невероятная однородность, бетона… дело в том, што если бетон, с неоднородной структурой, он начинаєт розрушаться, в течении 100лет… за сет того што при перепадах температур, разнородниє матеріали, имеют разноє свойство розширяться… то єсть щебень в бетонє, котрий ми привикли пихать, не даст бетону простоять, тисячи лет, он сам его розрушит, при перепадах температур… а вот однороднейший бетон, при перепадах температур, розширяється равномерно… По поводу енергостанций било указано, што «манна» енергетичниє существа, иногда, попадали с нло у наш мир, ети существа из гиперпространства, помещали в спец сосуди… и ставили в пирамидє, как источники енергии из гиперпространства, они витягивали, отуда енергію, висвобождая єє в нашем мире… Єгиптянє, изготавливали, електромагнитниє гармати, используя каучук, с каучукового дерева, привезеного, с південой америки… из конопли, привезенной с индии, бамбука, привезеного с индии…. Лев ти че несеш примурок…. Такоє не возможно…. Арах не мешайтє, ето науково фантастичний розказ, по другом научна фантастика, шо хочу, те й ліплю…. Орел ги ги… Цикало кажися, я всался, от смеха… Арах как появилися боги древнєго єгипта… дело било 7 тисяч лет назад… прилетіла небольшая флотилія, інопланетних кораблей…. Им нужна била добича, необходимих им минералов…. По скоку інопланетянам, не возможно било, просто начать добивать мінерали, месноє населениє, им надоїдало, нападая на них, они решили показать населению, могущество своїх технологий, штоб они, начали перед ними поклоняться.. и зав’язалася битва, страшная между войском фараона в 8тисяч человек, и 6 инопланетянами, и победили инопланетянє в етой битвє…. А по скоку они сражалися в спеціальних масках… их всех потом зображали как богов, из телом человека, и головой животного… так появилися, боги дрєвнего єгипта… осирис… вооружон енергетичним мечом, в ра особий тип боєвих браслетов, бат особий тип печаток, там еще и скіпетр бил, и маска, а также стандартная для инопланеян установка, напоминающая, нашу установку град, токо кручє, стреляла, микроракєтами, из тактичними ядерними боєголовками… діаметр ракети 2 см длина 25 см, скорость полета 400метров за секунду, дальность до 4 км…, скорострельность установки 500вистрелов за секунду… в установку заряжалась касета на 50тисяч микро ракет…. Микроракета, при ударє розривала все в радиусє 5 метров…   што мог подумать, дрєвнєєгипетский фараон, когда инопланетянє, накрили его військо, таким мульти штормом ударов… он никогда такого нє видел, и не слишал о таком, и инопланєтянє, били воздвигнути, в ранг богов…. Их стали слушать, им стали поклоняться… но боги били лиш людьми, такими же, как и здешнєєє, токо боліє технічно развитими, и с другой планети…     Лев ти достал….. скажи в чем суть вот ето всє видумивать… Арах в том што я ето ідеально умею, и на етом, можно зароблять, накативая сказки и басни о несуществующих мирах, о инопланєтних кораблях, и так далєєє, чесать… Лево я смотрю, ви хотитє стать, доктором наук, ну ти и дурак….

Ето как вплесне хуй торчит с мотора, руки на моторе, ключ идет по смислу… два часа напарник, открутить, нє может, с члена сделан краник…    Представим  СБУ начинаєт заливатся смєхом, уже полностью, ознайомившись со сказкой, начальник безопасности, служби охрани президента украини, єлє стоя на ногах, полусгибаючись, от смєха, заходит к президенту украини, подсміюючися… и начинаєт спрашивать, господин президент, а давно ви с инопланєтянами общаєтєсь… порошенко с кєм кем….

Арах а єсли подколоть, што ви с ними, тайно договариваєтєся….. Орел смішно…. А зачем ето… Арах суть в том, што ви человек очень принципіальний, понял, в вас єсть слабоє место, вас можно развесєлить, по настоящему, и за счет етого, сдєлать так, што ви будєтє готови, пойти на компроміс… от свого ви не готови отступится, но возможно, вєдь подобрать, альтернативний вариант, котрий интересен и вам и украинє, но при етом ето будет и нє ваш вариант, и нє вариант украини… украинскиє варианти вас нє устраюют… Орел нука нука, давай валяй… Арх. Первує видать закон, по котором чиновнику запрещено проверять, єсть ли на человекє, пришедшем к нему жучок, диктофон или відеокамера… то єсть дать посєтитєлям конституционноє право с ними к чиновникам заходить в украинє, и штоб чиновник не знал… Лев хтото таке уже задвигал… Арах второє розрєшить посетителям, платить, так називає миє корупционниє сбори в бюджет…  Лев корупція и так процветаєт.. Арах вобщето ето антикорупционна схема… допустим  я пришол к чиновнику с диктофоном, он нє знаєт, єсть ли в меня диктофон… и он мнє начинаєт намекать мол, нада проплатится штоб делу помоч, а то не подмажеш не поєдеш, я єму, раз у вас нєт желания, делать ето бесплатно фипишитє мнє официальну платежу, корупционого сбора… ви с нее ничего не получитє, но за услугу, прописаную в платєжкє, ви отвечаєтє, своїм робочим мєстом, єсли ви не виполнитє услугу, в строк, указаний в платежкє, ви будєтє уволени с работи, за невиполнєниє робочих обязаностей… с платежки деньги в бюджет идут, а ваша зарплата, из бюджета… когда я оплачу, вашу платєжку… получится следущє, я оплатил, ваше рабочєє врємя, необходимоє на виполнєниє, моєй просьби… єсли ви откажетесь виполнить роботу по платєжкє, вами займєтся отдел кадров, а деньги вернут…. Єсли ви откажетєсь виписати платєжку, вами займєтся отдел кадров, потому што ви не хотитє виполнять свою роботу, вам предложили, виписати платежу в бюджет, штоб ви сделали роботу, ви отказалися вмотивировать отказ… чиновник в меня таких как ви уже двести человек и по плану… по платєжкам смогу вашу просьбу виполнить, аж через 1.5 месяцев…. Посєтитєль, єсли я проплачу, ви приступите через 1.5 месяца к виполнєнию моєй просьби… чиновник єсли так договоримся она войдет в мой план роботи, и я через 1.5 месяцев, к ней приступлю… посетитель за скоко сделаєтє… чиновник три месяца…. Посєтитель меня ето нє устраюєт а можно ранше… чиновник визивай отдел кадров, в меня на ранше забит график….

Чиновник да… посетитель… виписавайтє платєжку, ето лутше, чем безплатно, бєгать к вам п’ять лет, постояно сидя в коридорах, каждий день и без толку… Лев тупая схема… Арах класна схема заплатил чиновнику, зарплату, и пусть сам, розєбуєтся как виполнить запрос, а ти в ето врємя от дихаєш или работаєш, вмєсто того, штоб сидеть у нєго под. кабинєтом и ждать, пока он снизойдет к тебе, с нєбєс…. Вершини свого положення… Путин а єсли не захочет сделать…. Арах єсли нє виполнит… будет уволен… о том што он не может виполнять, он должен сообщить еще перед тем, как виписати платєжку, или же в платєжкє, будєт указано когда он сможет начать виполнять и год месяц день, до какого он обв’язується.. виполнить… Лев ти дурной а єсли он откажется виписати платєжку… Арах запись розговора, плюс интернет заявлениє, плюс оплата работи бюро раследований…с сосєдней области… к примеру два следака… єсли моє заявлєниє подтвєрждаєтся деньги мне возвращают, єсли не подтверждаєтся… и виходит што я возвел наклеп… я штрафуюся тем, што мои деньги, не возвращаются… и більше, в государства, ко мне нет претензій, в отличии от варианта когда говорять ми не станєм раслєдувать, так как ви прошлий раз, нє правду сказали… тут правило покупатель проверки, всегда прав… токо єсли єго слова подтвєрдилися… єму вернут деньги, єсли нє подтвердилися, на ети деньги покриваються росходи служби роследования…. Тут даже разрешаєтся єсли к примеру громада, знаєт, што в чиновника, рильце, в пушку, скинулись деньгами, и к ноздре ему визивают то с обеси, то с симферополя, то с києва, проверку… и они прави, даже єсли, проверки ниче не дают…. Они уплатили розвлєчениє, для чиновника… они когут одновременно визвать всє возможниє отдели проверки… какиє єсть в украинє, єсли єсть деньги, штоб их визвать… если инфа подтвердится…. Придерся деньги людям возвращать…. Но у чиновников, мозги на место станут… тот кого поймали, на корупции в обичном виде, за забор… а корупционний сбор… нє дається чиновнику в руки… ето всєго лиш оплата в бюджет, штоб чиновник виполнил работу, и он обязан єє виполнить, иначє, єго вигонять… просто он должен обгрунтовать когда и почему, так он сможет єє виполнить… там и время в чиновников, на обработку появится, так как по сути, люди єго оплатили, и в неком родє, чиновник, трудоустроился на роботу, к посетителю, паралельно из основной, єсли он не виполнит, єму нечемо делать и на основной… роботє…    Орел а ето уже интєрєсно… но всеравно чиновников у вас нада наказивать… Арах а ми совместим идею цезаря наказивать при проиграше в битве каждого десятого… токо в отличии от цезаря, в нас будет боліє гуманно… никто не умрет… Орел а смисл, єсли трупов не будєт… Лев охренєть… ви щас споєтєся…. Арах зачеп смертю…. Нада позором…. Или чем то неприязним наказивать… нада ввести систему поощрения наказания, наказивающу одних, и поощряющу других, раз в три мєсяца…. А кого поощрить решают, голоса людей и деньги, уплачениє…. Лев…. Купить кого поощрить, кого наказати вообще дурак?... Арах ну а што єсли чиновники, мало пользи приносять, работая… пусть идут на «панель», заробатуют натурой…  Лев што што…. Орел а мнє нравится…    Арах суть в том што вначале чиновнику, дається ангельський и демонський ранг… первого уровня обоє…. Єсли чиновника, люди хотят поощрить, они кидают ему деньги или голоса….можно и то и другоє, в ангельський уровень…. 20-30% денег от кинутих в ангельський уровень получит 10% чиновников, с наивишим ангельським уровнем… при етом, каждий с них получит 20-30% токо с тех. Денег, коториє, били вкинути в єго ангельський урівень….. другим тоже самоє, по принципу…. 20-30% от вкинутих денег в их урівень…. Орел а вот ти говорил єсть и виртуальниє…. Верно понял… Арах ви прави…. Официально регестрируємся в систему, вносим даниє паспорта гражданина украини…. И єжедневно, на нашу учену запись, а на один настоящий паспорт, токо одна запись… две не может бить… нельзя…. Можно изменить, то єсть не работаєт…. Вводим заявку на замену страници, и нам єє меняют… зашли ми на страницу… в нас єсть віртуальний счет… на котрий каждий день начисляється до1000 виртуальних гривен, коториє ми бросаєм в какогото нравящегося, или на оборот, не нравящегося кандидата, ложа виртуальниє деньги, на ево «счет» в кандидата их два перший подержки, второй ненависти…  Лев так со счета можно снять… Арах да ето условний счет… с него он получит 20-30% єсли вииграєт по хорошем рейтингу…. И со счета он получит токо из вложених реальних денег, а нє віртуальних… также 10% получити з вложених реальних денег в плохой сет, єсли отбудет наказаниє…. При етом до одбития наказания чиновник знаєт токо суму реальниє+виртуальниє, а после отбития наказания от общей суми артистично, показатєльно, отимают виртуальниє деньги… и показуют скоко он собрал реальних, и єму виписиваєтся чек на 10% от етой суми…. Хтось скажет… а нафига давати 10% от собраних реальних…. Єсли от бил наказаниє, значит заработал….. Орел как же ето нада наказати….    Арах лидеру плохих наказаниє, номер один… вийти на сцену на стадионе, в костюме петуха, но штоб голову било видно, и не закривая лицо руками, представится перед всеми, во всємирном ефире…. Мол здраствуйте я петух Иван Иванович Иванов прибил к вам из верховной ради украини, должность депутат такого то скликання, фракція такаято…. Уже изберался скоко то раз… я с гордостю заявляю, готов отбить заслуженоє наказаниє, так как я самий не приветствуємий политик верховной ради, по тому, што на мой плохой сет, люди положили саме більше денег… не знаю реальних или нет но пора заробативать натурой…. И научится, на глазах у всех снести 25 золотих яиц, с промєжутком по 3 минути… между снєсєними яйцами… итого, я должен снести 25 яиц в прямом ефирє, за 75-100минут… по скоку, по мнению народа, я плохой политик… Орел да они сделают не задумиваясь…  Арах какиє яйца….. самиє отборниє, протухшиє, покриваються зеркальной краской, штоб блестели… и ложатся таких яиц в кармани костюма аж 50 штук… а вдруг политику, 25 покажется мало… идея така…. Штоб снести яйцо… политик садится в положениє присядя… достаєт с кармана протухше яйцо рукой в нутри костюма, и он должен сделать так штоб яйцо, упав на насест, а камера фиксируєт, момент падения, он не розбил яйцо, ложить нельзя оно долино упасть из зади, а там плохо видно, и не розбится…. Как би второй рукой, должен потянуть за веревку, штоб появилось впечатлениє, што хвост начал подиматся…. После чего он сносит яйцо, и ходит квокчет вокруг него, штоб ктото єго забрал…. После того как забирают яйцо, он повторяєт процедуру, пока 25 раз не снесєт яйцо… штоб оно осталося цілим… якщо з 25 яєць розіб’ється 10 то треба знести ще десять… навіть якщо всі 50 розібє політик, його затарять ще 50 яйцями, і буде їх нести, доки не буде знесено 25 цілих яєць…. Кожного разу коли політик буде розбивати яйце він повинен кричати кукуріку… щоб яйце забрали, а жінка акторка його ганить, поганий петух поганий, яєчка треба цілі нести…     Орел мда после такого никто не схочет оказатися в худшем спискє но зачеп єще и платить… Арах ето утеше ниє, за то што он стал самим худшим…. Орел … а не прощє штоб один счет… бил… первиє наилутшиє а последниє лузери…. Арах нет два счета и там и там определяются лутшиє 10% от верховной ради украини… лидер плохого рейтинга несет яйца в прямом ефире…. Встоящая за ним десятка, должни пройти через весь києв, по джипиес навігатору, при етом с закритими глазами…. Орел подсмотрят…    Арах я не правильно виразился, ми завязиваєм глаза, так штоб ниче не видно било…. Или одеваєм промишлений противогаз, в котором, глазки заклеени черной изолентой… на стартє видно на камеру, кто под. каким номером…. После того как одели противогаз… человек ничего не видит…. Єму дают палочку, для сліпих, штоб постукивать, и у яму не упасть, и джипиес навігатор, сообщающий в голосовом режимє, куда нада ити…  там после такого соревнования худших, в них появится… желаниє, помагать инвалидам по зрению… а то говорять што понимают как ето не видеть…. Я когдато поспорил с людьми што не слабо походить 2 часа из зав’язаними глазами, при помощи палочки, раз 40 не менше или врезался или упал или еще штото на протяжении 2ух часов…. Вобще ниче не видно… ето капец…. А мой друг получит за 2 часа більше 100 таких моментов…. То упал, то перечепился, то поскользнулся, то врезался… а ето на видео снимали….   Поетому к политикам нада пришвартировать по четире телохранителя в роли «ангелов хранителів» штоб с ними небило так, штоб просто почуствовали, как ето ничего не знать и ити на ощуп… охрана должна вменшаться токо в том случає, єсли явно упадет или нада перейти улицу…. Обачно незрячиє, сами єє переходять… для етого случая под. руки переводять… и весь етот процес… снимаєтся на видео… потом покажут в ютюбе, и по телевізору…. Соревнования, на то кто бистрее придет с одного места в другоє меж политиками… с закритими глазами… при том што нельзя пользоватся транспортом….. и охрана не имеет права подсказивать куда ити… и так єсть апарат подсказивания говорящий в голосовом режиме, джипиес навігатор… што он говорит, на какой улице находится… скоко поворотов нада пройти до места назначения и в каком направлении, также навігатор, говорит, ви движитеся в таком то направлении… а вот для сліпих таких поблажок пока нет как такиє навігатори, вродє, а нада… слепой нажимаєт кнопку, держит 30 секунд, определену кнопку, идет потом звонок оператору джипиес навигации, слепой или слепая говорит куда нада дойти, оператор через комп’ютер отправляєт, в комп’ютер навігатора, програму, и навігатор, начинаєт сліпому, росказивать куда едем, как едем, куда навігатор смотрит, скоко метров до поворота, гдє ближайший пешеходний переход, и к примеру штоб не нервирувать прохожих, от навігатора наушники… идут, а навігатор, спеціальний прибор одетий впереди пояса… Орел сам навігатор, штоб можно било оператору звонить, штоб поставил куда ити, хороша идея… все говорять да легко… по навігатору…. А тут же на самом деле голосовой джипиєс, єсть вариант… штоб в голосовом режиме кнопками вибирать адрес назначения… сначала улицу, как ввод первуй букви жмем більшу кнопку… нам говорит перва буква находится кнопка один в начале алфавита кнопка 2 средина алфавита кнопка три конец алфавита… нажали начинаєт перечислять букви буква «а»сигнал через три секунди говорит буква «б» сигнал…. И так далее когда слишит перву нужну букву  сразу после сигнала жмет кнопку один… говорит навігатор… буква успішно вибрана нажмите где находится втора буква места назначения… потом третя, четверта, когда єсть совпадениє, говорит єсть улица например «абрама» нажмите 1 єсли верно нажмитє два єсли хотитє продовжить ввод… например жмем два  доходим до улица «абрамовича»  к примеру опять совпадениє…  єсли нужна улица… нажимаєм один… допустим улица вибрано… дальше кажет к примеру, вибирете 1 2 3 гдє один начало улици, два середина улици, три конец улици… вибрати начало предлагаєт вибрать послідню цифру дома… а дом например 56 и диктуєт «0» сигнал три секунди, «1»сигнал три секунди, «2»сигнал три секунди, «3» сигнал три секунди, «4»сигнал три секунди, «5»сигнал три секунди, «6»сигнал три секунди…нажали сразу за сигналом перву кнопку… вибрали послідню цифру… шесть потом просит предпоследню… ввести, потом просит ввести стоко скоко нада на самом деле вибора… начало, конєц или середина улици не нада  а нада сразу вибор дома назначения…. Потом вибрать безопасний или не безопасний маршрут…. К примеру безопарний маршрут… имеет длину 700метров, навігатор его укажет, а не безопарний 200метров, то єсть по прямой….его в навігаторе нет, просто навігатор, бевкаєт гдє находится цель, по отношению к нему… и например менять тип маршрута можно… 1 безопасний, 2 микс полу безопасний, не сов сем точний маршрут, а тройка бевкаєт как пройти на пряму, умалчуя здания…. А вот второй говорит движучися по прямой, через 5 метров, ви столкнетеся из зданиєм, єсли зданиє обходить в право скокото метров, в лево скокото метров…. И так далее…   Лев зачеп оно нада… Орел а че прикольно… Арах путин прав… Лев што ти путину лестиш, а меня ганиш… Арах чесно… всем хорошим не будеш, нам нада не с вами, штоб росию на украину, не натравливали, поетому нада єго задобривать, не поощряя… а как ето сделать… одним путем, намилить уши своїм, типа бей своїх, штоб чужиє сміялись… заставить путина бояться не питайтеся, ето будет трудновато… а вот по настоящем смеятся, и етим потвердит, што ми внутр. Украини, можем и сами розобратся, совети ми не против получать, но решать нам, виполнять или нет, ети совети… а вот єсли путин засміється… он сам ето знаєт, што украина, способна и без вмешательства росии, решать внутрениє вопроси… и уши политикам своїм натирать, штоб светилися как новогодняя єлка… и прикольниє идеии видавати, лиш би било в политиков, желаниє их слишать… майдонутиє с украини, и не такого когут напетлюжить, просто Владимир Владимирович Путин, сильно мешаєт такоє делать… єслиб не било етого конфликта…. Ета сказка появилася би куда ранше…. В акурат к липню 2014 года…. Єє пришлося отсрочить, изза конфликта… а так би уже политики от очередного майдана вешалися… майдан сам с политиками розберется, скоко нада, скоко и вигоне, єсли нада, то и в хвост и в гриву дадут… Лев чердак поєхал…    Арах теоретично, созвать можно, пару милиардов кораблей, и милиардов двести инопланетной армии, плюс п’ять трилионов роботов, населениє 20 трилионов  … хи хи хи…. Заведуєт всем королева… лет 28 назад в них началося востаннє, а 23 года назад закончилося… в них било хароше месиво, населениє пошти в сто раз уменшилося…  правильно их било 2тисячи трилионов… повстанц, отдельно заговор отдельно и один королевский корабль отдельно…, на скоко хитрая королева, што с одним кораблем, отвоєвала назад, целоє королівство… ето же на скоко она хитра, и на скоко хитриє, в ниє должни бить дєти… я в принципє представляю, с чего би я начал, на єє мєстє, сначала виявил би тех., кто мог би помочь, отвоєвать, увел би их от замєса, потом вступил би в переговори с повстанцями, попитался с ними договорится, но не с заговорщиками, они не для того заговор клєпали, штоб с ними можно било договорится… потом при подержкє повстанцев, а также верних подразделєний, начать войну против заговорщиков… Орел ппц какая хитра, я смотрю ти решил, єсли гнать бєса, то уже по полной??? Арах не а што… єсли в нас политики, без пинка под. зад не сображают… как говорять знак омиє с майдана, пока били на майданє, и давали по маківкє, штото дєлали… токо ушли, сразу успокоїлися… нада би им хвост прищемить, штоб аж тявкали, и желатєльно, штоб инопланєтянє вездє ввижалися… да народ в нас изобретателен, и я в том числє, чего токо нє придумаєм…. Штоб политикам голова боліла…   Лев тебя никто не послушаєт… Арах идея проста как двери… зафигачить сказку такого ранга, штоб она била напичкана такими идеями, што єсли украинскиє политики, попитаються сказать што идей в сказкє тупиє, и я лично тупой идиот, они сами будут виглядєть самими більшими идиотами, єще тупєє меня… как минимум…  я такоє вколбашу… што реально нє придумаєш… Лев да што ти нєсєш…. Орел смєшно…. Арах обама походу спит… Обома нет, я слушаю.. дураки язиками трєщат… а умниє слушают…    Арах ета сказка, являється уникальной, интєлєктуальной петлей, которая автоматично, зашморгнєтся в интелектуальном смислє, на шеє того, кто попитається єє назвать идиотской, и так даліє, а почому… ето все таки визначально, подається как тупо, видуманая фигня, а человек, в правє, видумивать, в таком вариантє, што угодно, в такой сказкє, он в правє, назвать сєбя, хоть принцем інопланетян, и никто, никто не в правє осудить… фантастика, ето то чего нет… а вот єсли спецслужби, начнут питатся, както опровергнуть сказку, или засекретить, ето автоматично, будет означать, што они подтверждают, што написано в сказкє, и што они гарантируюют што сказка правда, поетому и питаються скрить… дєло в том што в научно-фантастическом сочинєнии, автор всєгда прав, и даже, єсли читатєль, с етим нє согласєн, єго никто нє винуждаєт читать, и пусть смотрит главноє правило, автор всєгда прав… ибо автор, сочинять должен, то, чего нєт, и может пользоватся реальними моментами… а вот, єсли спецслужби к примеру, начнут засєкрєчивать, ето будєт означать, што спецслужби, ставят свою печать, на даной сказкє, што там очєнь много, утекло засєкрєчєной информации, а люди начнут фигнєй страдать, видумивая… какая имєнно, информация, сєбалася с архивов…  тоже самоє касаєтся, єсли просто начнут ето сочинєниє, запрєщать…. Ето научна фантастика, вольного стиля, и на вольну тєму…     Лев ми сделаєм опровержениє етой сказки… Обами хи хи хи… я єщє нє слишал, штоб ктото в мирє, додумался питатся, видать опровєржениє, сказок, и научной фантастики… дєло в том што єсли кто либо, попитається опровєргать, ето будєт означать, што по поводу нуго правда там написана… и он хочєт опровєргнуть, штоб отбєлить, своє имя, но на научну фантастику, и сказки… опровєржениє, нельзя написать… жанр такой, што сам по сєбє подразумєваєт, што всє видумано… сам жанр допускаєт… штоб там била написана правда и токо правда или полу правда полу лож или токо лож… творчєство автора нє ограничиваєтся, што хочєт то и пишет… єсли питаються опровергнуть, запретить, засєкрєтить ето значит или там правда и токо правда или полу правда- полу лож…. Орел гдє таком можно научится…. Арах почему мнє и кликуху пришили «паук» интєлектуальну паутину, могу сделать таку, в жанрє фантастики, што и потєряєшся… вся ета сказка, интєлектуальная атомная бомба, способная визивать, нєвероятниє колєбания внутр. Народа, и в состоянии покоя, но єще большиє, в попиткє сказку запрєтить, опровєргнуть, или скрить…. Так как ето будет означать… што подтвєрждают.. што єсть масонський заговор, и они учасники єго, или же они учасники нефтєгазового заговора… на их вибор…. Могут сразу подбирать, какого заговора они учасники  и обявлять на вєсь мир…. Нє официально, но всє будут понимать, што ето имєнно так…     Орел слушай Лев… а вот говорять у вас в государствє, політика правитєльства… подчинєного масонам… и основна правитєльствєнна линия… дєлать всє… штоб государство нє розвивалося, штоб люди нє имєли вислого образования, так как управлять образованими людьми, нєвєроятно трудно, а вот людьми без образования очень легко, и для етого ви уничтожаєтє университєти в украинє…. Лев пошти всє правда, правда с унивєрситєтами, нємножко єсть и изза нєдостатков финансов, и фактично, нас могут остановить токо с вишим образованиєм, от розвала страни, и токо тє кто обучен масонству, обичниє люди нє смогу придумать, нє хватит знаний и прочего, штоб нам по шапкє, в одиночку настучать.. Орел а ето значит, што всє тили, у вас защищени… поскоку всє масони за вас… Арах ну да,а за них… пошти всє, кроєм подобних к масонам, их єще «лигой» називают… єсли такиє вмешаются, ето как би сказать «антимасони» штоли, ток не в планє, што фізично воюют с ними, а в планє, што интєлєктуально, составляют им противодействиє…. Вот к примеру появилась информация, в висших кругах украини… што на украинє долино остатся 5 милионов населєния, остачу уничтожить, и путин в етом поможет… какая сволоч мне прокоментируєт…. Єсли путин подтверждаєт ето, пусть идет фізично, войной на украину, и убиваєт граждан украини, єсли же он нє подтвєрждаєт, он должен інтелектуально, напряжать правитєльство украини, вродє, он «антимасон» росийской лиги… вродє.. єсли он пойдет войной, на украину… он подтвєрдит што он масон, и єго изначальна задача оставить в живих, 5 млн насєлєния… и што всє спасєниє братьєв, всего лиш виполнєниє, масонського заказа…  Орел тварь ти охуєвшая…    Арах соответственно народ росии, воспримет вас, господин Орел, как масонського волка, в овечьєй шкурє, котрий лиш говорит, што он хочєт помочь украинє, а вот хозяєва, от масонов, дали приказ уничтожить… Орел сука…. Шо це щє таке… Арах чего даже ми нє знаєм, знаєм одно, народ росии, послє етой сказки… запланированоє на апрель, вторжениє войск, єсли нє ошибаюся, воспримєт, как виполнєниє масонського заказа, и начується гражданская война в росии… по скоку Орел говорит, што он борєтся с масонами, а вот єсли начнет фізично, атаку на украину, фактично, об’яви, што он на масонов работаєт, а вся пропаганда борьби с масонами… и иностраной интервєнциєй, ето лиш рекламний ход… єсли Орел реально хочет, штоб украина присоєденилась, росии… пусть предложит украинє на каждом рєферендумє ставить вопрос? хотіли би, ли ви, штоб украина вошла в состав росии, а вот єсли он присоєденит воєним путєм… ето будет воспринято, как виполнєниє масонського заказа, из избиєниєм, котят, с оплатой заказа, в видє получєния тєритории украини… поскоку именно так всє и виглядит… со сторони…    Орел ну всє ти надоєл… Лев уже и вас достал?... Арах видел об’явлениє, продам квартиру на «бархатном» етажне дома…. Интєресно, а человек, писав ший обявлєниє, будет думать… а какой етаж… построєний из бархата? Или как… Лево всє остановим, ниче в вас нє вийдет, ми власть а ви нас слушаєтє, и не путайтеся под. ногами… Арах ви послє моєй сказки прозрєєтє, інтересно будет на вас глянуть, когда сотни тисяч сказок, начнут появлятсяя, дає ще и таких, што ви их не запрєтить, ни опровєргнуть нє сможитє, ми вас чисто казочками, запинаєм, не по детски… всє будут, от сказок на ушах…. Лев казочок ми не боимся…. Ето всє фигня… Орел тише, тише не провоцируй идиотов…    Арах призив всех, кто способен рисовать сказки, на политиков, типа той, што я нарисовал, или не способних, смотритє на мою сказку, и рисуйте свои сказки, нєбилици и прочую, лобуду на политиков украини…  и нє токо украини и росии єсли нада…. Орел ти што твориш…. Арах собираєм трєтий майдан, начинаєм новую, волну… просьба к росиянам, єсли путин армиєй в украину поле зет, со своєй сторони подтянутся в заміс, прямо в росии, ми майданом, сами розберємся, со своїми… в нас майдан розошолся лиш изза того, што в донецьке война и луганське война началася… закончится война… новий майдан начнем цени завишают, даже більше роста курса, ми не будем молчать, рост не пропорционален… гривна валится, и хрен с ним што валится, дело не в обвалє гривни, а в том, што нет позитивних изменений… майдан начнється начиная, с апрєля-мая 2015 года… за год не увиділи позитива… токо старий добрий сериал… политичєская санта-барбара по украински…. Системє оттяли голову убрав януковича… а тело, как качало с народа деньги, так и продолжаєт их качать, дає ще більше, и бистрєє, так как чуствуєт, што єму пиздец, не за горами… Орел ви систему не изменитє, ми прийдем и вам станєт хорошо… Лев не вертє єму…. Арах вопрос, а стоит ли верить вам обоим… Путину легче верить, он как вам сказать, скажу как єсть лутше враг, не скривающий своїх плохих намерєний, чем друг, ожидающий, когда встромить нож в спину… Орел то єсть я как враг лутше, по тому што от меня знаєш, чего ожидать? Лев а от меня, што не знаєте чего ожидать… Обома ето уже смєшно… какой клас у етой сказки????....    Арах ето базовий образец для масовой инт атаки, людей не участвующих в шехрезадє, и ставших на время начала операции, сателітами операции, хотя сама идея, операции, научить словом, рубить политиков, так штоб, аж офигивали… то єсть штоб сказки сочиняли не 1 человек, нє тисяча а милиони людей… ето очєнь хорошо, сказиваєтся на нервах, позволяєт вимєстить, всю свою злость в строки, написаниє пером, или на компютере… вилить душу одним словом, или создать, новую интелектуальную, революцію, созданиє майданов, нового поколєния, так називаємих, думаючих майданов, те коториє, думают, на десятки ходов вперед, коториє, вирабативают, свою стратегію, боротби, з политическим, свавіллям, а не просто людей, гибнущих ни за што, как било зимой декабрь 2013-февраль 2014 года… люди стояли за идею… и вродє как побєдили, и вроде как всє поміняли, но в итоге, всє на том же мєстє, как система с народа качала дєньги, так и качаєт, плюс кризи войни, плюс рост цен прєвишаєт урівень инфляции, єсли ктото считаєт, што я раз напишу, на етом закончится, так я напишу правила нового майдана…    Лев тебя убить, и на етом всє кончится… Арах програма, вєстся в души людей, а с ней и моє имя останєтся… Орел ниче не видет… Арах я не мозг, и не топливо, інтелектуального майдана, я всєво лиш програміст, базовой версти майдана новой генерации, и єго активатор, после вихода, в интернет, моя сказка, превратится, в интєлектуальну инфекцию, которая будет превращать, обичного человека, в думающего, человека, обичний майдан в думаючий майдан… Лев майданом, управляют такиє как ми, люди, не способни, к самоорганизации… Орел смотри, ато научит… Цикало кажись в меня чердак поєхал…    Арах етап перший нового майдана, как обично посто собратся толпє… Етап второй первак стадія самоорганизации, каждий пишет, свои идеи… коториє нада би ввести, и по очереди друг друга, слушают… худшиє идеи, вибраковиваются… в итогє таких дебатов, среди учасников, будет виделена каста «генераторов идей» по другому, «мозга» майдана, апарата майдана, котрий, чисто от майдана, без подсказок политиков, сможет генерировать цели и идеии майдана… Етап третий паралельно из формированиєм самоорганизации майдана, идет первичноє образованиє, самооборони майдана, первак линия одорони, должна бить роздана, импулисивно, токо собралися 25% подготавливаются вдруг чего обороняться… не думайте, што єсли политики, и вродє как своии, стоит рослаблятся… хуже всего, получить удар, от друга, по тому, што ти єго не ожидаєш…. Сонет майдану, не ожидать што политики как друзья, не ударят в спину, політика ето искуство, в нужноє время, в нужном местє, наносить удар в спину, и не думайте, єсли они, меж собою деруться, што майдан пожалеют… политиком не станєт человек, не способний на мерзкиє поступки, в интелектуальном смислє, советуюю ето знать, нужни крепкиє нерви, и умениє, отстоять своє, в нужном месте, сдать позиции, а в другом местє, захватить позиции, політика, ето інтелектуальна, игра, подобних к масонам, людей, умеющих думать, а людям, не умеющим думать, там будет трудно…    Орел как на проповеди в церквє…. Етап четире паралельно, формування першого временного правительства майдана Етап п’ятий форимрованиє первого временного рабочего строй отряда, для создания оборони, и комуникаций… к примеру жилищь…. Арах ви прави… Лев блять целоє государство…   Обома а майдан и должен стать временним государством в государствє, и даже, обзавестися, документациєй, и обрости юридичну форму, как временного образования, имеющего собствений внутрений устав, внутренииє закони, помимо законов страни, в которой он находится… должен кметь свого временного президента, и парламент, свій кабмін…. И уже на уровнє… прєзидентов… майдана и президента украини… требовать встречи… с президентом украини…  а вот мозг о котором  арах говорил, формируєт то што подаст президент майдана…. И так как президент майдана… являється официальним лицом, хоть и временно избранним, он может, подписивать, официальниє документи, с президентом украини…. И уже в таком случає… не виполнениє, президентом украини, договореностей, может закончится, для него, судом… в случає, єсли с политиков, снимут неприкосновенность… или же импичментом…. Даже, єсли он неприкосновений, а после импичмента суд… такоє может бить єсли майдан к примеру делегуєт права представлять временном президенту майдана, и к примеру, єго права, делеговани около 100тисяч людей, о чем гласять підписи, майдановцев, и на каждой підписи, стоит печать временного майдана, узгодженая с государством, то єсть официальная печать… политики не будут виполнять обещания, до тех. Пор, пока их обєщания не будут официально оформлени, и ратификовани, по телевиденью, и так далее… пока штото сказано на словах, ето лиш слова, а вот когда ето документ, с печатями и гарантиями, написаними политиками, ето уже юридичний документ, приходящий к юридичним обязательствам, всех сторон, участвующих в подписании договора… и даже после, роспада временного, государства, документ сохраняєт свою чинность, пока он нє будет виполнєн, боліє того, он может обязательствами, наследоватся следущим президентом, или парламентом…. К примеру подписан с Порошенко, што на протяжении 7 лет будет сделано.. то и другоє и трєтєє… порошенко пробил еще президентом два года…. А што потом он стаєт не чиним…. Нет остається чиним, токо виполняєт следущий президент…. Ето как бил договор о черноморском флоте на 20 лет…. Президенти менялися, а договор оставался, потомушто, он бил документально, оформлен, а бил би сказан на слова, он би стал не дествитєльним, как токо вишли из зала переговоров… то єсть, майдану нада, вирабативать систему, официальних лиц, официальних документов, майдана, официальних документов, нотаріального заверения, для того штоб создавать, договора с политиками, не на словах, а документально, за словесноє обещаниє, што его не виполнили, в суд не подаш, а вот за документальноє… соберется новий майдан, и подадит в суд, от шимени нового временного юридичного лица…. И 90% што он вииграєт судебник иск, в то врємя… как сказаниє на словах обещания, точно нє виполнятся…    Арах ага правительство стоко наобещало, стоко лапши, на уши навішало, лиш би майдан розійшовся, а ничего в итогє не виполнило, мотивируя, не било возможности виполнить….  А вот єсли би, ето бил официальний документ, из подписью чиновников и представите лей майдана, за каждим пунктом договора, и печатями государства и майдана, а также ратификован официально… а соответственно набравший державної чинності, повірте, знайшлиб можливості виконати, з запазухи б достали гроші які тікищо вкрали, і положили на його виконання… бо у такому разі, не виконання такого документу, є справою не совісті, а судово законодавчої, абож навіть кримінальної… і тут уже політик буде виконувати… не тому що пообіцяв( пройшов п’ять метрів, подумав обіцянка цяцянка, і не став виконувати..) а тому, що як мінімум, якщо він не викона обіцянку, з нього буде стягнуто, гроші, на виконання обіцянки, в судовому порядку, і дуже велика ймовірність, що гроші таки буде стягнено… і для виконання обіцянки, за гроші, виплачені по рішенюю суду… вона буде виконана… а далі класно…. Навіть якщо, політик, виграє апеляцію, оскілки гроші вже були витрачені на виконання а юридична особа яка була позивачем, зникла ще після підписання договору, гроші навіть при виграній апеляції, ніхто не поверне….  Табто в договорі може бути в казано, що після підписання договору, цей договір може бути, направлений до суду, в випадку не виконання політиком зобов’язань, будяким бажаючим громадянином україни, який зверне на це увагу, але він не є при цьму юридичним лицем, що його укладала, і він лише активатор договору, якщо не виконаний, до виконання в судовом порядку… тобто цей договір можна подати спочатку до районного потім вищого і вищого рангів, аж поки він не пападе в найвищий ранг, якщо весь час виграє суд політик, тому що в суді, держава надає безкоштовного адвоката… і при цьому позивача як такого немає, є лише людина, яка звернула увагу на те, що договір не виконано, і його треба змусити виконати в судовом порядку… далі класно… якщо в договорі буде прописано… що судові витрати… бере на себе чиновник у випадку суду… йому доведеться із власного кармана, класти гроші на адвокатів… потім доходе до європейського суду, в європейськом суді, якщо договір, оформлений вірно… суд дасть вирок на користь договору з імовірністю 90%... політик заплатить за дуже багато судів, потім за виконання договору…. Тому якщо він підпише договір в нього буде здоровеннй стимул, його виконати…    Орел я думаю майдан в слєдущий раз, ето всє примєт к свєдєнью, и немного доработаєт ету систему, на юридичном уровнє… основна суть… на подписании договора… есть временоє юридичноє лицо… майдан… и постоянок лицо ето человек с котрим договариваются… или сменноє юридичноє лицо… к примєру президент украини… и в договорє может бить указано… в случає не виполнєния русловий договора, президент украини, складає свої повноваження, і він оголошує нові вибори, президента украини достроково, і стає тимчасово виконуючим, обов’язки президента україни, доки не буде обрано нового президента україни… і варіантів безліч… так само і парламент  та взагалі, всі чиновницькі структури україни, можуть таким чином, «нагибаться» собраниєм людей создавшим юридичноє лицо, на время подписания договора, после подписания юридичне лицо прекращаєт существованиє, а чиновник, при не виполнении, виполняєт договор по рєшению суда, плюс платит судебник издержки… просто в договорє… указано… будьякий громадянин, помітивший що боговір не виконано, може подати клопотання до суду, щоб договір, був виконаний, в повному обсязі…   Арах Щорічно по такій системі, теоретично може, бути відсуджено грошей на суму від 1 мілярда доларів до 1 трильйона доларів… при роялті з системи в 5% на завжди…роялті складе від 50мільйонів до 50 мілярдів, доларів теоретично таке може бути, цікаво, цікаво… Лев ти попался, никто и никогда нє станет делать екземпляр договора боліє чем в двух-десяти екземплярах… один екземпляр чиновнику, а вот кто будет хранить тот второй екземпляр… Арах никто екземпляр временного майдана будет уничтожен вместє с юридичним лицом… Орел ги ги єдиноє доказатєльство уничтожить… Арах што што… будто ви у юристов небили…. Дєлається пару милионов копий, и напрягаются сотни нотаріальних контор… штоб заверили юридичну силу етих копий, как оригиналов у судє…. Строк действитєльности копии к примєру 25лет…. Или вечно… к примеру, одну копию заверили сразу в 6 нотариусов…. А штоб нотаріуси не морочили сєбє голову, проверяя кажду букву… собираєм в кучу, представите лей 6 натариальних контор, и под. их наглядом, на ксероксє, делаєм по 10 тисяч листов каждой страници договора… нотаріуси зная што левих страниц нету, прошто штамповкой, завєряют ети листи, типа конвеєра, производства имеющих законну силу оригинала, ксерокопій… дальше нотаріально заверениє ксєрокопии роздаються между учасниками майдана, а оригінал  или уничтожаєтся при роспущении майдана юридично, или же сдаєтся в музей истории украини… Лев а смисл…    Арах представим сєбє договор с чиновниками, заключин к примеру, на общу сумму, 10 милиардов доларов, к примеру на майданє последнєм, чиновники напели всяких благ…. Милиардов на 200-500 в доларах, ктото подщитивал, єслиби майдан собразил и прикинул, на каку суму напели… он би понял… нихрина не будут дєлать…. Там интернет сообщество считало…. Єслиби на всє сказки чиновников, били заключониє договора, послє етого нотаріально завєрени… копии уходилоб на каждий нотаріально заверений екземпляр от 5 до 300 гривен скорєє 10-15 грн, почему, економика… 10*10тисяч=-100тисяч гривен… на шесть контор… по 10тисяч грн. плюс по 3-4 грн за ксерокопію… Лев никогда нотаріус документ не заверти дешевлє чем за 300 грн… Арах ну тут то и прикол што один не заверти, а вот 10 тисяч в ряд… может согласится… ето будет как 33 документа по 300грн єму заверить, а вот по времени в п’ять шесть раз менше просто печатать на принтер ємного придерся синим цвєтом напись нотаріуса… ставить подпись и печать… 10 тисяч ето среднєє заробативаємоє нотаріусами за декаду или месяц… с 10 тисячами он справится по конвеєру за неделю… скажем єсли заверять не шестю а одним нотаріусом одновремєнно, он с руками и ногами возьмет єго… 10 тисяч екземпляров, по 7 грн с екземпляра, итого 70тисяч, возьмется  допустим какойто налог государству и тд и тп… допустим екземпляр стоит… 150 грн майдан, мог би сделать тисячу таких копий, и договорится гдє спряжать раз ниє копии к примеру карда сотня по екземпляру… ета сотня договорилась к примеру в банк на хранєниє, еще одни, на хранєниє комуто домой, трети на хранєниє, в камеру сберєжения за грницей.. и тд и тп…. Так би их политики и нашли ети копии… єслиби 80% етих копий покинули предели украинии… а когда не виполнили обязательства, политики, начали возвращатся, и люди их подавали би в суд….     Лев в нашой странє, скоко угодно, таких копий, єсли приказати, потєряяєтся… Арах в нашей да, в європе нет… из європи с одной нотариальной контори, куда притянули 10 копий, в украинский суд, направляєм одну копию, там уже урівень законов… єсли потєряли, возникаєт право, в боліє високого ранга инстанцию отправить, обновремнно в суд на суд, и в суд по копии.. и так даліє, пока нє дойдєт до європейського суда… в итогє, європейський суд будет судить, украинскиє суди… за то што тєряют ценниє документи… и обязани уплатить по 5% от суми на каку документи вииграют суд… то єсть виграли суд на 200млрд доларов…. Ще й суди заставят компенсировать по 10 млрд доларов, зная ето, господин президент, суд нє станєт тєрять, ети копии, даже єсли ето будєт приказ президента украини, и даже єсли в письменной формє, а то вдруг приказ потєряєтся, а их виєбут и висушат… Лев ну зачем, ну зачем ти ето дєлаєш… Арах по нормальном, не доходит, нужно как полагаєтся, об’яснить… чем мнє нравится бюрократия, тем што хоть и возни будет ужасно много, но боліє 90% обєщаний чиновников, в том числє и через суд, будет исполнєно, я нє юрист, но знаю, што и ето, возможно, єсли в «мозгє» майдана, будєт достаточно опитних юристов… коториє, такую красоту сделают.. зачитаєшся, дає ще и с юридичєской силой, дає ще так нада составить текст, штоб в текстє указувалося, што всє копии, завєрєниє нотаріусом, имєют одинакову, юридичну силу, как и оригінал, при подачє их в суд…. И когут бить подани в суд, кем либо, в кого на руках, такой документ, етот документ гласит, што чиновник гарантировал, виполнєниє, договора, под. власну відповідальність, і в випадку не виконання, зобов’язаний, за власний кошт, це виконати…    Зі мною зв’язався мій знайомий, просив декого знайти, щас я дещо опишу, а людина котра приймала участь, чи весь відділ, повинні летіти, на крилах вітру, швидше єдинорога та олення, вмісті взятих, в головне управління СБУ в Києві… служба безпеки україни, просто палає бажанням, познайомитися з цим відділом, в них, є маленьке запитання, куди подівся запис розмови, і чи ви подавали його до реєстру… справа в тому, що вони таємно розслідують справу, людей котрі за вами стежать, хочуть спіймати, на живця, ті хто піймався, коли відділ дізнання, бив їх тапочками по голові, вони зізналися, що стежать за цим віділом, колишнього кгб, котрий знайшли, по номеру телефона, на який дзвонила дитина…. Але СБУ не втямить, ніяк, як вони можуть знайти і допомогти вам, якщо ви, в архіви, не подали запис розмови 1990-1991років, ті хто за вами стежить, знають, навіть коли ви в туалет ходите, скільки солі в їжу кидаєте і так далі… а СБУ, не може вам допомогти, не змогли вибить, кого саме, переслідують… шановна операторко, не будьте, необережною, захистіть своє життя, здоровя, та своїх рідних, а також колег… зверніться до головного управління СБУ в києві… вони вам допоможуть, та вашим колегам… по інформації, наданої працівником СБУ, ці тварюки запланували, над вами експеримент…  вони хочуть випробувати, чи можна, вилікувати сибірську язву, та інші хвороби, шляхом магії, СБУ не може вас знайти, по своїм архівам, і не може, офіційно, про це сказати, тому попросили мене в інтернет викласти, для сміху, а там, можливо, і вам на очі попадеться… але я, лише цією історією, не обмежився.. Дзвінок  Операторка здравствуйте оператор тайной служба КГБ (здесь может бить ошибка какой именно служби) Ребенок а куда ето я дозвонился, шо це таке… Операторка как тебя зовут, скоко тебе лет..… Ребенок **** три года.. а вам 33(35) Операторка да а как ти узнал, ти што мисли читаєш… Ребенок а што ето ви цифри считаєте, и ждете лиш би до 45 секунди дотянуть розговор, хотите определить номер телефона, я вам не дам етого сделать Операторка господи, да меня же с роботи вигонять…     Досить цікаву інформацію, мені злили про таємну службу сбу… так званий відділ, магії і чародійства… они занимаются… наложениєм заклятий, созданиєм, зєлий вечной жизни, для того, штоб политики украини, могли жить вічно, різими пристрілами, та всякими магічними кульбітами…. Цей відділ стежить, за дотриманням магічних законів, а також займається співпрацею, з міністерством магії англії… Що робить таємний відділ СБУ…. По ночим, бігають збирають, бузину, котра є необхідним інгредієнтом, для виготовлення чарівних палочок… потім, цю бузину, витримують, в святій воді, на протязі, двох трьох років…. Місце, в якому, знаходиться бузкова деревина, для чарівних палочок, магічний реактор…. Що таке магічний реактор… це підземний бункер, зроблений дещо схожий на церкву…. З іконами, та іншими прибамбасами, залишився від таємної служби КГБ…  в даному бункері поставлені, над великі ємності для води, яка висвячується постійно, в центрі бункера, знаходиться, ємність, з бузковою деревиною, залитою святою водою… поряд знаходиться котел, для приготування, відьомських зіль… та інших речей… в даній церкві, постійно звучать молитви, що створюють, магічну енергію… котра, концентрується в центрі даного бункера…    Справа в тому що не обов’язково, магію, створювати звичним дідівським способом…. КГБ придумало, новий метод… постійно програвати… за допомогою динаміків… окремі звуки…. Наприклад, щоб програти звук, семиструнної гітари використовують, понад 60 динаміків…  вони розкладають, звук гітари на кілька сотень окремих звуків… наприклад одна струна видає понад 10 різних звуків… тобто… 5-6 звуків є цінними кожен звук, дає окремий динамік…. Відповідно, звук однієї струни, звучить одночасно із 6 динаміків… а 7 струн 42 динаміки плюс 18 на інші звуки…. З точки слухання мухики це тупо, але насправді, з точки зору магії, КГБ найбільші генії її серед спецслужб… і СБУ трима їх роботу в секреті…. Наприклад голос людини…. Має понад 200 складових…. Через звичайний динамік, людина, не відрізняє, мікро звуки, але в магії, кожна мікроскладова, повинна прозвучати, саме тому вони озвучують, кожну часточку звуку, окремими динаміками, що, як би дивно це не звучало, ствоює, справжні магічні коливання, при тому, що це лише технічні засоби, котрі повністю, імітують, звук чаріних заклинань, чаклунів, до кожної над малої складової звуку…. В такому випадку техніка, створює заклинання, а люди, кладуть почергово інгредієнти… і виконують, необхідні ритуали, для утворення заклинань та зіль…. Даний віділ, було створено, ще 1928 року… як відділ, магії та релігії її, там постійно молилися, святі отці… доки молитву, не навчилися, замінювати технічним звучанням, у вигляді мікрозвуків, котрі дають понад 1тисяча динаміків, одночасно….  По рівню… якихось там енергетичних коливань… що живий маг, що така техніка, енергію, створюють однакову… іншими словами, КГБ, навчилося перетворювати електроенергію, в магічну енергію… Орел пипец ти сочиняєш… Арах блин, уже в нас идей, че єще напечатать нет… походу видумали, што могли, народ щас всяку фантастику, магію, и прочу гадость читаєт… свого ума нет, нада в других одолжить, ето как черниє ведьми, воруют в людей сили…. Так ми не брезгуєм, спиздить, всє што хуєво лежит, в интернетє, и книгах… перекрутить, подшаманить, всякой херни натикать, в соседей и друзей идей насобирать, на роботє, уже собираєм, как можем…. Лиш би нам смоч убедить  што тут не знаю… ги ги никола теста вернулся…   . Арах Сегодня 21 марта, прислали преинтереснейший трактат, почитать, витяги из магии тайних сил… как использовать магію тем кто не имеет таланта, или же его дар, бил украден… кстати, ето актуально…. Темниє ведьми крадут, таланти у людей, а в трактатє, описан основной принцип, как ихнее зло вернуть им обратно, при етом себе вернуть талант, єсли єво украла, темная відьма, и так далее, сказали дать немного перекручене описаниє… там не столь важен порядок етого ритуала… а важна сама суть ритуала, и почему так….  Орел слиш, ти там, не стєми, екстрасенсами, што меня защищают, общаєшся… Арах не знаю, может бить… теорія така, ими прислана к примеру, єсли под. Кремлем, єсть подземний бункер, єго можно било прєвратить в церкву… с подвійним призначенням, перше призначення стандартне, як бомбосховище…. Функції бомбосховища не втрачаються, друга, як православна церква+магічні ритуали… тобто над потужний осередок святої енергії, та магії під кремлем… в якому, вони б поставили, надвеликі ємності, із святою водою…. Свята вода, виявля дуже велику здатність накопичувати святу енергію… 1літр святої води прирівнюється чомутотам…. Вобщем 1 тона святої води… дає енергію близьку до сили, звичайного екстрасенса… під кремлем, можна накопичити в ємностях до 500 мільйонів кубометрів святої води…. Не знаю де вони інформацію таку взяли…  це виходить церква здатна зупинити одночасно, 500мільйонів звичайних екстрасенсів… не знаю де вони таке вирили…. Што інтересно… святу води не сов сем обязательно святить так штоб священик, постояно молился… там нада штоб електротехніка постояно пела молитви…  существуєт три вида магии…. Вид перший магия души… самий високий клас… чисто екстрасенсорниє способности… дар человека…, тип номер два магия обрядов и так далее ритуалов и заклинаний…, третий тип магия молитв и звукових заклинаний…. Така магия действуєт, даже єсли електроника поєт…. И таку магію…. Можно использовать против ведьми, которая, отобрала у кого то дар… молячися, на запасє такой енергии к примеру в 1 тисячу тон святой води… енергія молитви, на таком запасє святой води, в церкви… способна, розрушить, темноє заклинаниє, черной ведьми, вернуть украдений дар обратно, а вот всю темну магію, сотворену, тємной ведьмой, одноврєменно, вернуть на нее с силою в три раза большей…. Как то так… и где они таке отрили… говорять прадавня тайна магия.. фиг єго знаєт… Лев херня якась… Орел очень даже інтересна херня…   Арах єсть вариант номер два превратить…  в прямом смисле, слова, водосховище или став…. В запас святой води… освячиваєм… на водохрещу…. Так енергія как би теряєтся, но ситуація… міняється коли ми створюємо спеціальні акустичні системи, котрі співають з допомогою електрики молитви… навіть в такому варіанті… з того що прислали… накоплюється енергія молитв….. на ставку чи водосховищі… ставимо маленьку плаваючу капличку… відпливаємо на середину… молимося про поверненя здібностей таа повернення всього, що було зроблено… енергія активується… і в молитві вивільняється, із святої води, енергія.. котра здатна повернути дар… одночасно всім у кого їх викрала відьма… для цього лише необхідно, щоб один із тих, в кого викрадено дар… помолився богу на великому запасі святої енергії, котра здатна накопичуватися в святій воді… даний принцип, взято із, магії волхвів… вони вміли заряжати окреме поле своїми заклинаннями, в наш час це на багато простіше… через те що можно створити, спеціалізовані акустичні системи, на електриці, які саме це будуть робить…    Лев дурак ти, таке не можливо… Арах я не раз чув про теорію струн… в фізикі… про те що деякі частоти і звуки в певній послідовності, здатні викликати навіть ядерний вибух… і начебто цьому є історичне підтвердження… Лев яке нафіг підтвердження… Арах чули про Раму… проте що він воював…. Це доведено вченими… але вибачаюся там так виходить,   або в нього були ядерні ракети…. Абож він викликав закляттями, ядерні вибухи в трьох містах індіїї, а вчені вже довели, що зброя, якою розправився рама з ворогами, була ядерна, абож заклинання… базальт не може розплавити ніщо, окрім ядерного вибуху… а міста, котрі знищив рама, були так знищені, що навіть базальтова порода, під ними розплавилася… а це означа, або те, що в древній індіїї, широко була розповсюджена ядерна зброя, зокрема ядерні ракети, абож вони знали закляття, здатні виконати, той самий ефект…. З допомогою коливань звуку, створити розпад атомів, в певній точці…. Доречі, теоретично, це дійсно так….. якщо знайти резонансну частоту коливання певного атома…. І створити, над потужний або ж навіть слабкий потік… резонансних із частотою ядра атома коливань… теоретично за рахунок резонансу… ядро атома, почне руйнуватися…. Перетворюючись на атом, наприклад на один протон менше…. І наприклад в теорії так можно перетворити свинець на золото… скоріше за все резонанс не звуку, а електромагнітних хвиль… але теоретично… резонанс здатен… відірвати протон, від атома… що вивільнить з атома енергію в мільйони раз більшу, ніж знадобилося, щоб зруйнувать ядро атома, знову таки алхімія… і так далі… Лев… чего, резонанс может ядро атома, розвалить… ти че несеш…   Арах а никола тесла кстати вроде ето упоминал, што он может визвать маленьким ящичком резонанс… котрий нанєсет массу разрушений… так вот я думаю, он омел ввиду не междуатомний резонанс…. Частот…. А внутріатомний резонанс частот…. А в ядра атома… есть своя резонансна частота… теоретично, використовуючи її ми можем ядро зруйнувати…. Лев не вийде люди пробували…. Арах нехай… припустімо тоді інше… створимо, щось на кшталт… штучного нагріву атомів… за рахунок резонансу…. Наприклад, при резонансі, амплітуда коливань атомів, сильно збільшується, теоретично, при одній і тій самій температурі заліза… наприклад 20 градусів цельсія… ми створюємо резонанс частоти звуку… котрий викличе резонанс, внутрішніх міжатомних коливань заліза…. Справа в тому… що при однаковому температурному режимі, теоретично атоми заліза, почнуть коливатися з набагато більшою амплітудою… наприклад коливався з амплітудою 10*10в мінус 11степені мм, а під час резонансу, амплітуда виросла в 20 раз….. справа в тому що резонанс… підвищує коливання в десятки тисяч раз максимум, але як мінімум в сотні раз… припустімо, теоретично, що при цьому, атоми починають охолоджуватися… так як діє закон збереження енергії, і атоми, збільшуючи амплітуду коливання, перетворять теплову в механічну… відповідно, температура атомів, упаде наприклад в 100 раз… наприклад… атоми, заберуть теплову енергію, навколишнього середовища, після чого ми припиняємо резонанс… енергія коливань переходе в теплову…. Атом мав температуру 293град кельвіна… під час резонансу ми його загнали до температури… 5 град кельвіна… він набрав тепло до 290 град кельвіна, припинили резонанс, коливання перетворилися в тепло… після чого температура, стала 570 град кельвіна….     Абож по іншому…  ні дійсно цікаво… ось почали ми коливати лудь ледь… з резонансною частотою… а тут на тобі, будинок розвалюється… енергія механічного резонансу, дуже потужна…. Теоретично…. Якщо поставити…. Стінок, котра, …   Лев завязивай с етим…. Арах…. Тут «мишка» через интернет идею подганяєт…. Ктото пробивал… натянуть к окну…. Нитку, через булавку…. Вставить к оконной раме… и как от ростояния зашибись колебания усиливаются….. так вот в нее идея… взять штото типа такого принципа…. Токо чисто магнітну пластину….. діаметром скажем, 200 метров…. К ней чепляєм на край таку. Нить…. От етой нити пластина, начинаєт в вакуме колебатся… при етом в притул к пластинє котушки… коториє начинают снимать енергію магнітних колебаний, и преврашать в електрику, ржу не могу, но в теории может вийти, єсли котушечки видадуть напряжениє, вольт по 10 с минимальним током… дальше теоретично, если… пластина в резонансє, она колеблется максимально сильно…. Ктото скажет ем не вийдет… блин… а вот звук через нитку как передається там єще не факт… не прикольна теорія…. Лев да замолчи уже…. Арах он «заяц» говорит єсть опит о левитации Месером сделаний…или месмером… пофиг как там типа… електромагніт, из сверхровоодника, стоит с кондором, а над ним висит… магнит левитируя…. Так вот в него…. Теорія…. А нафига нам етим не воспользоватся… Орел слишал об етом опите, как токо ти електрику забираєш магнит опускається….    Арах все правильно…. В него немного извращеная теорія…. Ставим сверхпроводник меж двух магнитов… один под. магнитом, от котрого отталкиваєтся верхний…. На верхний воздействуєм резонансом колебаний, от чего его сильно начинаєт телипать, возникаєт переменноє магнитноє напряжениє, визивающее в сверхпроводнике, електроток…. Его ми забираєм…. Как токо ми, перестанем, колебать резонансом, верхний магнит…. Он повиснет в определеной точке… ну теоретично ето так…можно сделать…. Даже подскажу как… допустим в нас есть два магната… один и второй  теоретично они попитаються повернуться своїми любимими полюсами, поетом нижний не подвижно закреплен, е к верхнему, прикреплена, ужасно прочная трубка, из диетектрика, к примеру пластика, на конце какой, в низу стоит груз, то єсть ето система, противовеса, котора не даст магниту, провернуться…..в теории если внутр. Такого магната, поставить…. Микроякоря…. Коториє дают магн поле…. Верхний магнит, станет переменним…. И он начнет колебатся с некой частотой, с которой крутится якор…. И гдето в низу, на нашем грузє, стоит магнит, котрий єстественно колеблєтся, и проходит сквозь котушку, из сверхпроводника, и с нее забирається електроток… теоретично, така система, может потреблять в 10 раз менше енергии на запуск, чем вирабативать… чесно сам не понял….. как ето закрепили, гиганский магнит, сквозь него, с верхнего магнита, идет пластикова трубка…. Критим якоря или в верхнем или нижнем магритє, што приводит к тому, што магнітна напряжоность меняєтся….  Теоретично…. Нижний имеет раз мер… ширина 10метров, висота 10 метров, длина 10метров вобщем магнітний куб… над котрим висит магнит куда по мелчєєє весом в 10 кг из противовесом в 2 кг…. Етот магнит… под. силой гравитации, при условии што якоря внутр. Малого, нейтралезуют поле опускається к примеру, на два метра ниже…. Когда якоря усиливаєт подимаєтся вверх… на противовесє стоит котушка, котора при прохождении через магн поле, вирабатуєт електроток, котрий идет на роботу, в верхнем магните, на вращениє якоря… типа система циклится… а енергія тратящаяся на нейтрализацию и активацію роторами, таращится што єй єще сделать, прямо зависит от діаметра и количества… роторов… типа чем менше діаметр якоря(я и сам так считаю), тем менше енергии нада приложить штоб провернуть на 360 градусов….там как би все соблюдено…. Всє да не все  сделай так …   Петух  стою на плацу, я у лижи обутий, чи лижи не їдуть, чи я єбонутий…  Орел  петух!!!! На плацу…. Да єще и в зимних лижах… інтересно какой из солдат, тебя в лижи одел, животноє… тєбє мєсто не в лижах,на плацу, а в супе в видє мяса…. Орел ви што гонитєєє.. Арах ясен хуй, што прикалуємся… питаясь соченить, штоб било похоже.. што инопланєтянин наєбашил… видели сериал днєвники вампіра? И так далєєє… а ми для спецслужб, решили заєбашить днєвники инопланєтянина… а то они рослабилися… Лев как ви такоє думаєте вєбать… Арах очень просто… иностранци… коториє нормально знают язик…. Розговаривают на украинском, а так же пишут, довільно странно… било рєшено написать, в таком же стиле, как пишет большенство иносранцев, коториє вродє и язик знают, но тем нє мєниє, их трудно понять, кат как они дєлают множее ошибак, и одновременно не правильно многие слова пишат, а также странно строять пєдложения…. Идея появилась косить под. иностранцев…. Плюс нафигачить такого… што знают токо спецслужби… и инопланєтянє…. А обичним людям не доступно….                              	Початок 	Рік 1976 таемна служба нквд, група особливих досліджень НЛО 	Рік 1939 таемна служба нквд, група особливого кодування інформації 	Рік 1980 таемна служба нквд, група генетичного дослідження екстрасенсорних здібностей 	Рік 1970 віділ внутрішньої безпеки, таемної служба нквд 	Рік 1991 обеднання чотирьох відділів в проект неземний     	Відділ особливого кодування, було створено за наказом Иосифа Исарионовича Сталина 1939 года. Задача, яку цій службі, дав Иосиф Исарионович Сталин. Состояла в создании сверх шифра, такого класса, какого ни у кого нет, штоб он бил таким, штоб противник, даже если у него, окажется тисяча листов запечатаного текста, к тому же он знал шафр каждой букви етого текста, не смог расшифровать весь текст, как би не старался…. 	Спочатку представили собі, в супротивника опинилась тисяча листів тексту, котрий передали шифром, і сам зашифрований текст, відповідно розгадають за п’ять хвилин весь шифр, проте їм була поставлена задача, щоб не розшифрували, по можливості, ні слова з решти зашифрованого текста… 	1942 рік, допоміг випадок, хтось не нароком, неправильно написав шифр, задом на перед, і не могли втямити, на іншому кінці, що їм надіслали, надіслали що нічого не розуміють, що надіслали, цього разу їм повторили, шифрування, але правильно, виявляеться, телеграфістка, вирішила пожартувати, і надіслала шифр задом на перед, за що отримала догану, таємний відділ нквд, про це почув, і взяв цей метод, собі до уваги. 	В 1943 році, хтось з партизан, почав надсилати, неймовірний шифр який не могли зрозуміти, як виявилось той хто надсилав, мав не справний передавач, і інколи точка перетворювалася на тире…. Що робило шифр, не придатним, для читання… проте таемний відділ нквд, вирішив за рахунок цього а чому б не спробувати, створити на одну едину букву відразу 100 шифрів, наприклад на букву «а» 10001, 39087…98706 і надсилати букву, не кожного разу одним шифром, а кожного разу новим шифром. Для цього дійства, пристосували азбуку морзе, але тут був спочатку сигнал зв’язку, потім передавалися серії цифр, потім кінець зв’язку. Серії цифр розшифровувалися в знаки, так зявилося перше двоступеневе шифрування. 	В 1944 році було ув’язане двоступеневе шифрування, в перше триступеневе шифрування наприклад буква «а» код 34567 за кодом ставилось три цифри наприклад 345 і шифр набував наступного значення перше непарне число читання в зворотьньму напрямку, друге парне його додавали до шифра, трете не парне, його віднімали від шифра, що виходило 34567 3+4-5=2, 4+4-5=3, 5+4-5=4, 6+4-5=5, 7+4-5=6 обернене написання 65432 і в кінці 345= 65432345 але зашифровано шифр 34567, досить цікаво… а при сабшифрі 245 це виглядае так 23456245, так зявився перший триступеневий шифр, на 1970 рік він уже був 25 ступеневим, але все по черзі.. я всього не знаю вибачайте.. 	В 1945 році, шифр став п’ятиступеневим був патвел 456 наприклад, певна буква алфавіту як Ш що означало що кожна парна цифра не мае значення, і сабшифр у кінці, Що означало патвел перша цифра, якщо парна ділилася на два, і віднімалася від зашифрованого шифру, якщо не парна перша цифра додавалася до шифру, друга якщо парна вінімалася від шифру, якщо не парна нічого не робили, третя казала де знаходиться сабшифр у шифрі якщо парна на початку, якщо непарна у кінці, як виглядав шифр із попереднього року 23456245 патвел 1 число 4, ділили на 2 отримували 2, віднімали від шифру 2-2=0 3-2=1 4-2=2 5-2=3 6-2=4 шифр виглядав 01234, друга не парна нічого не робили, третя парна сабшифр на початку, сабпатвел Ш парні числа не є шифром.456Ш(2)9(4)7(5)4(0)7(1)3(2)7(3)8(4)9 в скобках указані ті що читаються, після букви Ш а зовнішній вигляд 456Ш2947540713273849, або 456Ш2748590117253540 це один і той самий шифр, котрий може бути написаний в 99999 комбінаціях варіантів, за рахунок чисел які не читаються всього дана методика, дозволя написати букву а в 10в 10 степені варіантів, самого шифру, плюс…10 в четвертій степені написання без зміни самого шифру, тобто якщо противнику попаде сторінка тексту і він зможе знайти відповідно зашифрований текст, в нього, досить великі проблеми, із розшифруванням тексту який далі зашифрований, решта історії тайной служби кгб засекречена, я її не знаю, лише знаю що на 1970 рік шифр букви а виглядів приблизно так АААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААРОНАЛИУС998705873875875376753875874568768376878673543875575783673636569526534 ЗАРАЗ ДЕСЬ ТАК АААААААААААААААААЕГШПКПППГГШГПУПШУЕГУГЕУПОУОПОЛЕ87638675358639287898457883657683338763736835483835373533664536574743 УЯВІТЬ СОБІ ЗДИВОВАНЕ ЛИЦЕ АГЕНТА СПЕЦСЛУЖБИ СУПРОТИВНИКА В КОТРОГО ТИСЯЧА СТОРІНОК ТЕКСТУ І ВІН МАЕ ЗАШИФРОВАНІ БУКВИ, АЛЕ ПРИ ЦЬМУ ШИФРИ БУКВ НІКОЛИ НЕ ПОВТОРЮЮТЬСЯ, І МАЮЧИ РОЗШИФРОВКУ 1 ТИС СТОРІНОК НЕ МОЖЛИВО РОЗШИФРУВАТИ НАВІТЬ ОДНУ БУКВУ З НАСТУПНИХ ШАНС ЗДАЕТЬСЯ 10 В МІНУС ДВАНАЦЯТІЙ СТЕПЕНІ ВЗЛОМАТИ ШИФР, НЕ ВИЩЕ, ЗАШИФРУВАТИ БУКВУ (А) МОЖНА В 10 В СОТІЙ СТЕПЕНІ ВАРІАНТІВ, КРУТО…      	Вторая в списке тайная служба нквд, сфера иследования екстрасенсорних спосібностей человека, спец проект сетка, точнее одна из секретних ее ветвей. Даная служба изучала, как проявляется екстрасенсорная способность у людей, и обнатужила што даная способность имеет 100% наследственний характер, тесть токо генетически склонний к екстрасенсорним спосібностям человек, способен стать екстрасенсом, иними словами, есть отдельно взятие люди, которие никогда не смогу стать екстрасенсами, по каким би методикам они не занимались етим… таких не много… в мире всем кажется, што любой, кто захочет сможет овладеть екстрасенсорним даром, ето далеко не так.  	Все дело в генах. Вот представим себе в матери черний цвет глаз, в отца черний цвет глаз, а у ихнего ребенка к примеру синий или карий цвет глаз, и отец не долго думая, начинает гризть жену, в меня черние в тебя черние глаза, а в ребенка голубие, с каким таким голубоглазиком, ти загуляло чудо мое небесное… жена начинает оправдиватся, господи ти боже мой ти в меня перший и единственний, я не знаю наверно в нас ребенок мутант….. давай кА ево отнесем в больницу и нам скажут, што с ним, приносят врачю ребенка, и росказивают невероятную историю, вроде и жена не с кем не гуляла, а ребенок мутировал, глаза в него голубие.. Врач хитро прищуривается, и спрашует, а ви перед сексом, мутатор мили? Отец ребенка, не понял о чем ви, врач уже подсмеиваясь, гнет свою, ну ви перед сексом, член не помили, поетому в ваших сперматозоїдах, произошла неожиданая мутация, которая привела к столь не ожиданном результату. Отец господи, неужели, я в етом виноват, и што же тепер делать, ребенка в детский дом отдать? Врач отцу, скажите, а ви до психиатра давно ходили, провєряли, все ли у вас з головой в порядке.. Отец ето ви к чему, клоните доктор, што я? псих….? 	Врач, ну ви учили генетику, или хотями слишали о спадковості та мінливості, домінантних та рецесивних ознаках. Мать да зачем нужна мне била ваша генетика, я в то время, полезно время проводила, строя парням глазки, штоб они подошли познакомится, в итоге с мужом познайомилась… отец ну в меня похожая ситуація вместо вашей никому не нужной генетики, я искал способ как снять девушку на вечер, или на неделю, пока не познакомился с женой, она меня строптивого жеребца, загнуздала, как єй только хотілось.. 	Врач смеется… да смотрю в генетике ви «абсолютний ноль». Если би ви не пропускали уроки биологии в школе, я не говорю, об изучении генетики, как науки, ви би знали, што ваш женщина, и ваш мужчина цвет глаз определен домінантним геном, а вот у вашого ребенка, рецесивная ознака цвета глаз. Отец а што ето значит? Врач думаю ребенок, не мутант, осмотрел, вроде здоровий, и ето нормально, што ево цвет глаз, отличается от вашого, хотите сделайте днк аналіз на отцовство.. 	На самом же деле екстрасенсорние способности как и цвет глаз, и все остальное, подчиняются законам генетики. Поетому и существуют родовие екстрасенси, в родових екстрасенсов ета ознака, обачно, домінантна, тесть она постоянко проявляется в следущих поколених, при условии, што такие роди, женяться на подобних себе, тесть с циганського рода мужчина, на женщине с украинского рода, прикол в том што национальность, не имеет значения, но самие сильние гени, у циган… там есть своя заморочка, м не хочу их розозлить, не буду писать почему именно, тот кто знает, тот и без меня знает… 	Виходит такая штука есть доминантние и рецесивние гени чуствительности человека, их КГБ прозвало, генами екстрасенсов… тесть в семье где нет екстрасенсов, может такое маленькое чудо появится, способное читать мисли, видеть будуще, прошлое и прочне способности, за счет того, што в ребенка, совпали два рецесивних гена, дающие екстрасенсорную способность, и если в родителей ети гени, давали токо интуицию, то в ребенка, впоєне может оказатися, будут очень даже мощьние екстрасенсорние способности, и даже возможно, он будет одним из самих сильних екстрасенсов свого класса.

Корабель побудований з металу назовем його «кілхацієм», це наприклад, титан, але в даного металу, кристалічна решітка, така як в діаманту… тобто його отримано шляхом затвердіння розплавленного титану, під дуже великим тиском від 200 до 1 тисячі атмосфер, в такому випадку, титан перетворюеться в аналог діаманту, але його кристалічна решітка, не з графіту, як в діаманту, а з титану. Цей матеріал, можна лише обробити використовуючи різці, куди твердіші за діамант, наприклад, з такоюж кристалічною решіткою використати вольфрам. Так ось, корпус робимо з «кілхацію» він неймовірно твердий, і досить міцний. Щоб порівняти , якщо фальшиву броню танка, зробити з «кілхацію», кулі, від нього, будуть просто відскакувати… через те що він неймовірно твердий, і досить міцний, бо кристалічна решітка з металу… іншими словами, майже як «криця», але криця по іншому виготовляеться.. там над тонкі прути металу, перекручують між собою, багато разів, наприклад біля 1000 разів, потім заготовка дуже довго куеться… в середині утвоюеться шар неймовірно твердого металу, зовні мякого, мечі і шаблі самозаточуються в битві… 	Зробили ми корпус, далі начинка, там дуже велику кількість кабелів, для електрики необхідно прокласти.

Наприклад… в нас маеться поверхня, з якої потрібно забрати тепло, температури 150 градусів, в неі заливатися рідкий азот, охолоджує до 0-100градусів, далі нагрітий рідкий азот в іншому місці зріджують, він видає температуру до 400 градусів цельсія, це дае змогу, провести випаровування води, запустити теплову турбіну теоретично, така технологія теплового насосу, дозволяе створити такий тепловий насос, який крутить парову турбіну, виробляє електрику, котрої вистачає не тільки щоб турбіна самозациклилась, а й близько 50% енергії, котру виробляє дана турбіна, пустити в інше місце для споживання, тобто, вічний двигун, без вічного двигуна… закони збереження енергії соблюдені, ми забираємо тепло, охолоджуючи грунт, і перетворюємо в електрику, з кпд 30-35%, а тепло що не перетворилося в електрику, зациклюемо тепловим насосом, на випаровування води, а недостачу, добираемо із грунту, розмовляв, я з енергетиками в Україні, кричать в Україні таке не потрібно, нікуди нафту і газ дівать, і це в умовах енергетичної кризи.. при тому, що Україна себе не здатна, забезпечити нафтою і газом… я им вас не смущаєт, што можем пожаловатся, они в ответ, нам начхать, ми как люди опитние, понимаем што ета гадость, 100% может работать… девахи с Киева то самое втирали.. им ответили.. а то што ето фантазія, не втирайте по ушам, ви расчети дєлали, некоторие гази требуют, в 100 раз менше, енергии для сжатия, чем водяная пара, и если все прощитать, вот и получится ваша гадость с затратами на зацикливание 30-50% от вирабативаемой електрики… но представте себе, если их построить, кто станет покупать, дрова, уголь, нефть, газ… все будут продавать електрику полученую, от таких источников, потомушто, хоть она и дорогая, изза цени хладрогенов и материалов, топливо на нее не нада куплять, а значит, через некоторе время она не просто окупится, а и начнет приносить пошти халявную електрику.. украинский президент, не розрешит такого, люди меняются, но политическая линия.. остается той же самой.. если он розрешит ети установки разробативать, так и будет.. но скажу вам так, ви думаете што ви первин ее придумали? Фиг там, ее еще в СРСР придумали в 1980 году, и по етом я знаю што она точно будет работать… ето дівахи с Киева, запись розговора присилали, сказали ппц у нас е***утое государство…     	Итак вернемся к кораблю, такая установка, охлаждает корабль, и позволяет непреривно работать генераторам, для чего ето нада, с двух причин перває охлаждение корабля, штоб не перегревался, вторая для виробітки електро енергии. Зачем на корабле електроенергія? Перове для роботи електротехніки, систем жизнеобеспечения, компютеров, и прочей лобуди на корабле, а второе, для создания перегрітого пара, для реактивного типа турбин корабля, и за сет использования перегрітого пара снижение рас хода, обичного реактивного топлива, в два четире раза… Каr ето работает… пропускам воду по трубам под. давление около 200 атмосфер, через атомний реактор, она нагревается до температури, 500-600 градусов цельсия, за ней пропускам по трубам, с нагревателями, на вольфрамових нитях, нагреваем воду, до температури 1000-1200 градусов цельсия, такая вода, под. таким давленим, впорскуется в турбину, вместе с реактивним допливом, и повишает силовую тягу турбини, уменшая росход топлива. топливо.. реактивное, дает температуру 3400 градусов цельсия при сгорании, и изза того, што ето очень большая температура, ее нада понижать, ето причина номер два использования перегрітого пара, струя вибрасиваємая турбиной имеет температуру, 2000-2200 град цельсия     	В Украине какая політична система? Мабуть народ все делает для влади, а не влада для народа.. причин может бить много… 	Мои предложение, ставить на виборах не галочки у отельного кандидата, а галочку возле каждого кандидата, оценивая ево… к примеру по п’яти бальной системе, от 1 до 5 балов, красная графа 1 бал, оранжева 2бала, жолта три бала, салатова 4 бала, зеленая 5 балов, думаю дальтоников в стране не так много, мало кто перепутает цвет графи, ето типа світлофора для политиков, побідит тот в кого суммарний бал наивисший, а 20% людей из списка, ето люди, которие когут его заменить, если начнет биковать… тесть 20 процентов от избираемих когут заменять по очереди более високих, если не справляються, к примеру верховной раде, на роботу не ходять… «отличника» можно заменить на тем кто имеет сумарний бал чучуть по ниже. К примеру перший Порошенко, второй Тимошенко, третий Яценюк, четвертий Кличко, п’ятий Николаенко, шестой Свериденко и тд и тп, такая система дает еще один обгрейд политичной системи, начальние предвиборние застави на виборах президента не 2 млн, а к примеру 100тисяч грн., вот тут уже возникнет настояща конкуренція, и кандидатов будет не 30 как обачно, а так себе, человек 500, не менше, затянется виборчий процесс, но при етом… ми получим абсолютно адекватную оценку піддержки кандидатов, да да ви не будете изберать, из 10 злих, наименее злого, штоб он прошол на виборах, штоб зліші нього, не перемогли. Ви зі спокійною душею поставите 1 бал злим на вашу думку, а 5 балів найкращим на вашу думку. Тобто ви оцінете всіх, а не когось одного…. Так дільниця для голосування збільшиться, самих кабінок для голосування до 50-100 раз збільшиться, через те що процес голосування буде довшим… але ми отримаемо там нові обличчя, да ще й всі будуть розуміти, переміг, не бикуй, а то наступним в списку замінять… яким чином… коли голосування провели.. склали рейтинг кандидатів, наприклад Порошенко 4567 із 5000, Тимошенко4566 із 5000, Яценюк 4566 із 5000….. наприклад яценюк і тимошенко, порявну балів….  Пропоную перевагу відати жінці…..  якщож рівне число балів між жінками… то дивимося у кого найбільше відміток 5 балів….

Ну а ким повина бути жінка, котра відважилася змагатися з чоловіками, котрі вважають, що це суто чоловіча справа, але на справді, це мабуть, скоріше жіноча справа, політика, а не чоловіча… бо в політиці потрібно витворяти, як зміюка, підколодна, по другому ни як… тому, кожен політик, збира собі, команду, від 10 до 100 гадалок та віщунів, і подібних людей, щоб, йому передбачалили майбутнє, а також, гадали на кавовій гущі, а також, на тому, як замерзло сциклиння, насяне політиком в тарілку, які узори на ньому появилися….

Николай  Я тоже пробовал крутить асинхронник 220/380в 180Вт 1280 об.  Конденсаторы 3*10мк. При нагрузке 100вт на фазе было 210в.   А вот и схемка  Если у вас нету света...  Juris Indulens Вот результаты.  Асинхронный двигатель 750 Об/мин 900Вт  А можно словами, для чайника - чего получилось-то?  Читал где-то, что асинхронник становится генератором только если его крутить номинал+ 10-15% т.е. 750+75=825 об/мин давать надо было. Не так?  Николай Так. Если обороты мотора 1500, то в генераторном режиме его крутить на до 1500+5-6% По крайней мере я читал так.   Последний раз редактировалось Николай 19-04, 20:00, всего редактировалось 1 раз.  Александр Правильнее сказать - ""не совсем так"". Дело в том, что привязка к оборотам нужна асинхроннику только в режиме асинхронного генератора, то есть ведомого сетью. Если же мы подключаем конденсаторы для возбуждения- то генератор уже не является больше асинхронным, несмотря на то, что сделан из асинхронного двигателя. Это уже - синхронный генератор. И обороты, на которых он будет генерировать, определяются ёмкостью конденсаторов и величиной нагрузки.  Valday Александр  Вы сказали то, чего я не мог добиться на старом форуме ни от кого.  Значит при номинале конденсатора при котором он работал с сетью генератор начнет возбуждаться при оборотах, например, 1500+5%, а если конденсаторов повесить размером больше сам чем двигатель, то сильно при меньших оборотах?  Александр Valday  Да. Этот эффект наглядно продемонстрировал Валерий. В данных по измерением, что он выкладывал, это видно. Тут проблема может быть связана с тем, что кроме всего прочего, напряжение на выходе, а также обороты такого генератора - сильно зависят от тока нагрузки. Получается, что подключая нагрузку на выход генератора, мы вносим в конденсаторы сопротивление потерь. Естественно, при этом меняется реактивная составляющая тока возбуждения, поэтому мы наблюдаем снижение напряжения на выходе генератора. А чтобы сохранить параметры генератора, мы должны при подключении нагрузки увеличивать ёмкость. Вот тут и возникает техническое неудобство регулирования такого генератора. Я уже раньше, ещё на том форуме - высказывал идею о подключении нагрузки через конденсаторы большой ёмкости. Теоретически, это должно решать проблему. Но сам ещё это не проверял - не успел. Поэтому конкретных рекомендаций у меня ещё нет. Только мысли. Не исключаю, что могу и ошибаться.  Теперь выскажу мои соображения по ёмкостям. Тут есть золотая середина. Если ёмкость чрезмерно большая, то генератор, естественно, возбудится при меньших оборотох, но радости от этого будет, на мой взгляд, не очень много. Он будет тратить огромную часть своей мощности на возбуждение. То есть, жрать мощность ветроколеса будет, а отдача при этом будет маленькая. По моему мнению, меньше, чем на 1/3 - не стоит снижать обороты. Хотя, могу ошибаться и здесь, надо проверять. Кстати, когда Владимир пробовал запускать движки с конденсаторами в качестве генераторов, он столкнулся с таким эффектом: при большой ёмкости конденсаторов, особенно, если емкость и индуктивность попадали в резонанс на некоторой частоте вращения, наблюдался жуткий рост напряжения и генератор начинал греться. При этом сильно возрастала нагрузка на сверлильный станок, которым Владимир его крутил.  Как бы там ни было, эксперименты провести не грех. Польза будет всем.  Valday Александр  Не нравятся мне асинхроннки. Как у них КПД посчитать, не зная подводимой мощности? Когда я крутил однофазный мотор, то меня совсе не впечатлило, что когда генератор возбуждался, то станок напрягался. И при подключении нагрузки было такое ощущение, что звук станка не менялся...  Кузнец когда генератор возбуждался, то станок напрягался. И при подключении нагрузки было такое ощущение, что звук станка не менялся...  Такой эфект наблюдается,пока асинхронник попадёт в нормальный режим. Так же он будет сопротивляться повышению оборотов.  _________________ Забитый молотком шуруп,держит прочнее,чем отвёрткой закрученный гвоздь!   Vladimir Чистая правда  . Я сейчас другой идеей приболел , я вынул из асинхронника ротор , проточил его в тикарке и выкладываю полюса из магнитов от ""мертвых бабушек"" .

Привет, здесь бывали? http://www.fieldlines.com/story/2007/6/19/9056/23438  Для Вашего случая вроде полезно.  Там еще есть ссылка на руководство (PDF), если не работает, то я уже скачал, могу прислать.  _________________ С уважением, Анатолий. Не ""партизан ветра"" - счетчик поменяли...  Valday Конечно бывал ! И не только    Могу всех порадовать результата,и переделки.  Сразу предупрежу , что весь проэкт был для проверки работоспособности идеи , поэтому воспринимать все спокойно:)  Как подопытный кролик был выбран асинхронный четырехполюсный однофазный двигатель со стартовой обмоткой и фазосдвигающим конденсатором (1 мкФ) , мощностью 250 Ватт. Сопротивление обмоток :  рабочей 20 Ом , стртовой 50 Ом . Диаметр ротора до переделки 66.5 мм , рабочая высота ротора 46 мм. Ротор был проточен до диаметра 59.8 мм и на него наклеены 68 магнитов диаметром 6 мм и высотой 3 мм в четыре полюса , так что в каждом полюсе три линии магнитов 6 , 5 и 6 (шахматка) , угол наклона строчек относительно образующей ротора 7.3 градуса .  После проточки и переделки ротор был установлен в родной статор (где заблаговременно я срезал фазосдвигающий конденсатор) получился генератор с двумя фазами расположенными под ""углом "" 90 градусов .  Залипание минимальное - ротор поворачивается пальцами. При испытании в токарном станке :  120 оборотов - холостой ход на первой обмотке 35 Вольт , на второй 15 Вольт  210 оборотов - 50 Вольт и соответственно 20 Вольт  Подключал подсаженный аккумулятор от УПСа к низковольтной обмотке - при 210 оборотах на нем 18 Вольт и идет активная зарядка.  Понятно, что для нормального генератора надо выбирать двигатель с низким сопротивлением обмоток , для лучшего согласования с нагрузкой , но результат в целом - положительный .  П.С. Фотки выложу на днях - комп дома поломаный    _________________ Чепятанье и Арфаграфия мои сильные стороны - не механика.  Александр Генератор можно сделать, причём, довольно хороший. Для этого надо его чуть-чуть доработать. Сперва следует отсоединить статор от ротора, после чего вывести наружу все провода. От каждой катушки статора - отдельные выводы. (Конкретно в Вашем случае - следует расстыковать статорные обмотки и вывести эти концы наружу.) Это делается для того, чтобы подобрать оптимальную схему соединений. Следующий этап - экспериментальный. Соединяем все статорные обмотки параллельно и то, что получилось, подключаем параллельно ротору. Подаём какое-нибудь постоянное напряжение. Двигатель должен вращаться, но при этом жрать ток. Если не крутится - можно пробовать поменять местами выводы одной из катушек статора. После подключения к источнику питания двигатель должен быстро набрать обороты, но они будут не очень высокими. Затем он скачком их сбросит и при этом должен появиться звук, словно двигатель кто-то держит за вал.  Если так происходит, значит, двигатель может работать генератором. Вращать нужно в том же направлении, в котором он вращается в режиме двигателя.  Теперь отключите его от источника питания и подключите к его выводам вольтметр. Далее, намотайте на вал шнурок и дёрните за него. ( Как я уже говорил, вращать следует в том же направлении, в котором он вращался в режиме двигателя.) Двигатель сперва разгонится, затем, загудев, сбросит обороты. Вольтметр покажет напряжение на выходе. Если так произойдёт, значит, получился генератор.  Я проводил эксперименты с двигателями постоянного тока и все они являлись прекрасными генераторами. Даже почти низкооборотными: в моих экспериментах получались значения оборотов от 400 (примерно) до 1000 об/мин., в зависимости от конструкции двигателя и комбинации его обмоток.  Анатолий Вот, спасибо! он уже низкооборотный(1500), но насчет переключения схемы не знал. Попробую на выходных.Статор и так идет отдельно.  Александр Сто процентов - выйдет отличный генератор. Но разобрать его всё же рекомендую, поскольку его статор имеет две полуобмотки, включенные последовательно. Если Вы разорвёте эту последовательную цепь, а затем соедините их параллельно, то обороты уменьшатся примерно в два раза. Хотя для начала - можно пробовать и так, как есть, включив статор параллельно ротору.      Последний раз редактировалось Александр 27-02, 20:19, всего редактировалось 1 раз.    Анатолий Пробовал вчера пока без разборки. Просто подал на статор 30 волт,  ток100ма, и просто покрутил рукой. Неплохо! при вращении прим 2 об\сек 2вольта, ток кз 1а! но, к сожалению, от этого гены придется  отказаться. Он нужен для станка. На выходных пойду по развалам,  поищу магнитный мотор.  Александр Постарайтесь найти мотор большого размера. Чем он будет больше, тем на меньших оборотах сможет эффективно генерить.  Анатолий спасибо, бум искать.  Valeriy Николай  Что скажете?  А что сказать, все путем получится.[/quote]  Valeriy Николай  3 фазы, по 8 пазов на фазу, 4 катушки. С первого в четвертый паз, следующую в 7 и 10 и переворачивать (если в одну сторону намотаны), чтобы напряжение сложилось. Провод засовывать частями, если толстый, по одному. Никаких сложностей не вижу. Единствено ротор фигурный надо, чтобы магниты прилегли.  Арах  Єсли сделать гигантский генератор, ФАЄТОН, висотой 200метров, діаметром 500метров ротор, якорний, двополюсний… а всє котушки статора, сдєлать нє большиє, при етомдовольно плотниє, к ним нагрузить кондори огромной ємкости… теоретично… обпутаний такой статор, будет генерить нє худе обичних генераторов за счет ємкостей, при етом, ротор врядли будєт залипать, для уменшення сопротивления, охлаждаєм статор, жидким водородом… єсли в статорє, нє будєт феромагнетиков, то магнитноє полє ротора, будєт воздєйствовать на статор, как перємєнноє магнитноє полє… а котушки, будут принимать енергію, по типу радиоприємника… при етом, индуктивноє сопротивлєниє, будет минимальне, также тєорєтично, будет минимальнє потрєблєниє магнитной енергии, но в котушках сверх огромноє количество витков, поетом, напряжениє, очень високоє, и довільно високий ток, при етом, реактивноє сопротивлениє, убираєм до минимума, за сет того, што  первує, обороти 0.5-1 оборот за секунду, второє ротор имеет мин сопротивлєниє, за счєт того што магнитноє взаимодействиє из статором минимальне, а сопротивлєниє идет токо індуктивне, на ротор.. поди считай, сдєлать генератор забирающий 90-95% ел енергии…  Александр Індуктивне менше, а реактивного пошти нет, может и вийдєт, с чем токо в мирє нє столкнєшся, генератор с миним индукт сопротивлениєм…. Там обмоток нада еще метров двєсти делать диамєтром, и ставить собирающу електротєхнику… індуктивна котушка, єсли ее поставить рядом с ротором, создаст електромагнітне поле… но єсли сразу же за ней поставить єще одну котушку, теоретично, она поглотит часть енергии етой котушки, в меня мисль крап другая… ротор такой как у тєбя, а вот статор сдєлать по другом… сдєлать зазор метров п’ять, поставить перший ряд котушок, очень огромних из конденсаторами, наматуя котушки нє на целосний статор.. а на очєнь фрагментирований, тєорєтично єсли магнитноє полє ротора, дудєт проходить, через статор, то перший ряд статора, прєвратится в електромагніти, коториє, попитаються, взаимодєйствовать из ближайшим об’єктом, ел магн полєм, так как ротор довільно далеко, они на него дают довільно слабую от дачу, уменшая индуктивноє сопротивлениє, за первим рядом, ставим второй ряд потом третий и так даліє, очень даже плотно, так штоб слєдущий ряд, статора, воспринимал, індуктивний поток, как магн генерику.. от ротора, ето сожрєт індуктивне сопротивлєниє на ротор… то єсть єго фактично нє будєт..  Valeriy Слушайтє, вєдь в генераторах нада зазор минимум, штоб магнитноє полє нє расєивалося, хотя при таком роторє, боюся оно даже з зазором в 20 мєтров, пошти нє будєт росєиватся, слишком мощний магнит ми вращаєм, ето токо провєрять, блин ету хрєнь, люди бєз государства никак нє построять, ето нє реально, одна она обойдєтся в трилиони доларов, а вот єсли заработаєт, а ето возможно, ето будєт круто, вечна енергія, в таком вариантє, індуктивного теоретично пошти нєт… и реактивне минимум, хотя фиг его знаєт….  Арах  Слушай тут фишка в том, што етот ротор, більше целесообразно, использовать как ротор привода, вокруг нєго, поставить кучу якорєй, коториє вращаєм, они будут виполнять роль котушок, для того штоб начать вращать ротор, ми обачно создаєм вращающееся магнітне полє, с помощу котушок, но вб можно такоє полє создать и вращениєм постояних магнитов, а вот енергію, котору нада приложить, уменшать за счєт того, што ми делаєм тонкиє якоря, коториє потрєбляют на вращениє енергію по формулє точнєє принципу, Фм. И на потрєблєниє в нютон на метр оборота… в отличиє от генератора, гдє ето ничего не даст, в приводє двигатєля, ето может дать ефект… поскоку… магн полє якоря в нас мощноє и целосноє, и оно легко взаимодєйствуєт из малими якорями статора, они малого диамєтра, но большой длини… виходит оно работаєт, как многофазний ел двигатєль, асинхронного типа, из смєщениєм вращения под. углом, там к примєру, отставаниє якоря от статора 20градусов, и сила взаимодействия статора к ротору будет прями зависяща как Фм*косин фи… соответствено, скоко якорєй в статорє, к примеру тисяча…. Каждий якорь, взаимодєйствуєт из ротором силой Фм*кос фи… но при етом на весь ротор в итогє оказиваєт влияниє…  1000якорей и сила взаимодєйствия… будєт 1000Фм*кос фи…. Виражатся она будет в нютон на метр….. итак прощитуєм якоря статора… діаметр 1 метр… длина окружн пи*Д=3.14*1=3.14 метров… то єсть енергія котору нада приложить как минимум длина умножена на Фм= к примеру 3.14 * 1800нютон на метр= 6000кгс…. На оборот или как то так… но при етом в нас их одна тисяча итого 6 млн кгс на оборот…. Нада потратить… а тепер считаєм виходи з ротора…. Сила общего взаимодейств на ротор… 1800*1000….=1.8млн нютон на метр… но длина окружности, при диаметрє 500метров равна 3.14*500=1.57км…. и за оборот ротор видаст…. 1.57км*1.8млн нют на метр*кос фи=1.57*1.8*0.7=1.97милиардов кгс за оборот…. Сравниваєм показатєли…. Тратим 6 милионов кгс на оборот но при етом теоретично, отримуєм1.97 милиардов кгс на оборот…. Раз ница в триста раз…..  Александр Да ето кстати нада проверять, нєсмотря на множество против возникших в головє, єсли якоря статора, крутить червячним редуктором, слушай откуда взял…  Арах В нас єсть одна коза, имєющая космічний корабль, так ета хуйня из єє корабля взята, просто там мини якоря 1.5 см діаметром, а вот центральний 12 или 13 метров диамєтром, кстати КГБ, и прочиє, знают етот тип вєчного двигатєля, они єго тихосєнько сєбє использували и спользуют, и в хуй не дують…. А людям, нефть газ и уголь покупай… вобще миром, в неком родє, опосередковано или на пряму, правят иниє цивилизации, та мишка сказала.. в том числе и єє цивилизация Азенхров, просто их штоб скрить, американци сняли сериал, зоряні брами, перший загін, и в сєриалє показали ихниє корабли, для того, штоб єсли ктото снимєт на видєо их корабли, можно било сказать, вот нє видумуйте, ви нє сни мали ни какого НЛО, ви сделали постановку, типа снимаєтє НЛО… насмотрєлися фильмов, фільми ето самий класний способ скривать правду об НЛО, то што показано у фильме, єсли ктото их сфоткаєт или снимет на видос, всєгда можно сказать фотомонтаж… типа ви сделали модель на турбинах, с помощю радиоуправлєния она взлєтєла у воздух, ви єє сфотографировали, или сняли на видєо, поетому, оно виглядит как настоящєє, а внєшний вид ви взяли из фильма, и никто нє докажет што ето настоящее… Поетому, очень би хотілось, попросить иниє цивилизации, штоб прилєтєли на зємлю, и начали єє розрисовивать с помощю лазеров, рисуя знаки шестипелюсткова ромашка, триелектродний атом, два схрещених меж собой триугольника и мєч…. Прилєтайтє иниє цивилизации, рисуйте лазерами знаки, устройтє фотосесию для рєпортєров, позируйтє для видєокамєр, покажитє себя во всій красє, покажитєсь рєпортєрам, во всє возможних ракурсах, єсли будут показивать штоб покрутились, покрутитєсь,  устройтє всєпланєтний парад иних цивилизаций, штоб увидєл каждий ребєнок, каждий взрослий, на етой планєтє…. И видел на протяжении месяцов, штоб уже ни одна спецслужба мира, нє могла заявить, а то били нє корабли… просьба, когдаспєцслужби отправят на вас войска, нє убивать людей, єсли будут очєнь настирниє, истрєбитєли бомбардировщики, и так даліє, росто лазером, хвости м срєжтє, или половину крила, так штоб пилоти могли катапультироватся, а єсли будут стрєлять из буков и прочей пво… тєпловиє лопушки, противоракєтна оборона, лазерна оборона, а также миниракєти….

The other month, I was shocked when I rented ""Maze Runner"" and discovered it is another movie about the world after over 90% of the world's people are killed.  There are also ""love songs"" about a couple being alive after the sky falls. Why do people support Hollywood and movies like this? Divergent, The Hunger Games, tat Will smith movie, Maze Runner and I am sure that at least 10-15 movies have been made since 2009 about over 90% of the world's people being killed and then starting over in a living in a military state where the people who survive after the apocalypse will wish they were dead and be used against each other. When you see The Maze Runner, you get the idea that people will be fighting machines. I don't want to go Terminator on everyone but, there is actually a company called Sky net and humanoid robots are becoming more and more of a reality. It probably already is and we're just being introduced to the idea or accepting this through seeing movies of men falling for robots.And I've seen a celebrity  on t.v joke about having a helicopter when the world ends. I am not saying I think the world will end and at this point I don't care. So many people not only refuse to believe the truth but, they will help prolong suffering and they will help cover up murder, rape and torture while accepting that their food is being poisoned.

On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward (of his evil or good deeds), and what he left behind (of his good or evil traditions). Nay! Man will be a witness against himself [as his body parts (skin, hands, legs, etc.) will speak about his deeds]. Though he may put forth his excuses (to cover his evil deeds). Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an, O Muhammad ) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad ) the ability to recite it (the Qur'an), And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad  through Jibrael (Gabriel)], then follow you its (the Qur'an's) recital. Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you, Not [as you think, that you (mankind) will not be resurrected and recompensed for your deeds], but (you men) love the present life of this world, And leave (neglect) the Hereafter. Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and radiant). Looking at their Lord (Allah); And some faces, that Day, will be Basirah (dark, gloomy, frowning, and sad), Thinking that some calamity was about to fall on them; Nay, when (the soul) reaches to the collar bone (i.e. up to the throat in its exit), And it will be said: ""Who can cure him and save him from death?"" And he (the dying person) will conclude that it was (the time) of departing (death); And leg will be joined with another leg (shrouded) The drive will be, on that Day, to your Lord (Allah)! So he (the disbeliever) neither believed (in this Qur'an, in the Message of Muhammad ) nor prayed! But on the contrary, he belied (this Qur'an and the Message of Muhammad ) and turned away! Then he walked in full pride to his family admiring himself! Woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you! Again, woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you! Does man think that he will be left Suda [neglected without being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord (Allah) on him]? Was he not a Nutfah (mixed male and female discharge of semen) poured forth? Then he became an 'Alaqa (a clot); then (Allah) shaped and fashioned (him) in due proportion. And made him in two sexes, male and female. Is not He (Allah Who does that), Able to give life to the dead? (Yes! He is Able to do all things).",0,0,Emily Jones,yftHosO0eUo,0.021372767857142854,2015-06-10 05:25:17,False,True

Don't get me wrong, it's all action, it's good, but five minutes into the movie I was able to predict 90% of it. Have you seen Taken? 2012? You're gonna become a seer too! The Rock calling his daughter in a big house? Ok, obviously separated parents, mom's got new, rich boyfriend! Also, at the end of the movie the guy will die so the parents can get back together. Father is a rescue pilot? that's convenient, as well as all the cars, boats and planes they will casualty encounter to reach their destiny. University teacher speaking about history's biggest earthqueake, of a 9.5 in Chile? I bet you all I have the movie's earthquake will be of a 9.6  Don't get me wrong, it was good! I just don't think they wanted me to find it fun to the point I laughed half of the movie.

2016-01-13T01:24:44,"I was reading up on a couple of things this movie got wrong. Things like, the San Andreas can't cause a tsunami. Or how earthquake faults don't crack open which is very true. And how the San Andreas can't create a 9.6 quake.  If you look at a San Andreas fault map on Google images, or maps or wherever, the fault actually goes into the Pacific Ocean once it gets to the San Francisco area. About two miles out to sea from the Golden Gate Bridge. And from what I heard, SOME parts of the fault line are locked. Meaning that it's under so much stress that it's not even moving. ( At lease I think that's what it means. So correct me on that if I'm wrong and if you know ). Now one things for sure, in Southern California, the San Andreas is locked. So the next time it moves, Southern California will feel it the most. Which will be a 8.0 quake or greater. I'm not sure if it's locked in the bay area. But if so, the next time it releases a next big earthquake in that area, would it create a tsunami?  Some people also say that when the next big one hits that it won't be as major as the movie shows. I have a book called 'Earthquake Storms' by John Dvorak. And it's based on the San Andreas. And it said that the S.A. has actually made other fault lines across California. Like the Hollywood fault, the Hayward fault which is in the San Francisco area I think, the Newport-Inglewood fault, and the San Jacinto fault. Not to mention a fault that was NOT created by the S.A., but is pretty powerful called the Puente Hills fault. Which runs through downtown L.A. and is putting the city at risk of experiencing a 7.5 quake.  And not to also mention another fault that was not created by the S.A. but is 30 times GREATER then the S.A. called the Cascadia subduction zone. Which is putting the West Coast of the U.S. at risk of a 9.2 or greater quake along with a 100 foot high tsunami. The Cascadia does connect with the San Andreas in Northern California. So when the next big one hits, what if the San Andreas were to trigger ALL of the other faults that I mentioned? Which is quite possible, and would naturally be way more disastrous but the movie doesn't mention that part?  Also in the movie 2012, it showed California sinking in to the ocean after a 10.9 quake. The book also says that the San Andreas will NOT cause California to fall into the ocean. Instead, the S.A. fault and it's many subsidiary faults are slowly tearing California apart, so much of what is CA today will be transformed into a collection of islands that are destined to be rafted northward across the Pacific.",0,2,The New Yorker Railfan,yftHosO0eUo,0.08182432432432435,2016-01-13 01:24:44,False,False

Typically, faults are associated with, or form, the boundaries between Earth's tectonic plates. In an active fault, the pieces of the Earth's crust along a fault move over time. So following on to our conclusion, the moving rocks can cause earthquakes, and believe me, I know it's a lot of fun on the westside, but make sure you make it on time to reach the right side of the fault.

They showed this trailer before the movie started and just a few days prior, my grandfather had explained to me how everyone has been expecting a big earthquake even ever since he was a boy, and it still hasn't happened.
