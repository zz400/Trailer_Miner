If they wanted to go for a fantasy setting at least still show Genghis khan but show him as being this powerful being, a horrific being. As that is the picture they painted themselves as to put fear into their enemies. But he should be neither bad or good and who's come to unite the lands under his rule for his own reason. Not make it so black and white where you have these dragon-like beings that are pure evil and the qin dynasty are saints. That time period was pure grey. It doesn't matter how fantasy you want to make the film, if it isn't deep and complex it will not spark interest and success. It should be more symbolic.

I will give some reason why.  1.the way the characters talk is kinda like some one put some Chinese word into google translate and got somethings that made some since to a guy that to English in high school for 2 years. The actors have a really bad accident God damn you could've learned at least hire some fluent English speaking Chinese or better yet how about hiring American Chinese. Even the native English speaking actors seem to have an accent.  2. The amount of cgi and how bad the quality is. Did we not learned anything from avatar the last Airbender cgi everywhere looks bad. Probably should have this hot expectations because it's made in China so good on you for not making another food war.  3. Don't Trump doesn't appear in this.  4. Mexico didn't pay for the wall  5. What are the pink, yellow, and blue power ranger doing in medieval China and monster are they fighting in this episode.  6. Now for the main reason why don't like this movie. It is a cash grab to get in on the Chinese Cinema. They made in it China or with Chinese company  so they be one of 30 something movie that get approved by the communist government. The only reason they have American actor in there is to appealed to the Americans viewers.",2,0,Random Stuff,avF6GHyyk5c,-0.0355128205128205,2016-10-10 01:31:26,True,True

The purpose was to fend off white walkers...oops I meant Hun raiders.     In the next dynasty, Han Dynasty, massive counter attack of more than 300,000 troops was launched by Han emporer after they were finally fed up with the constant treat from the north.   Chinese record says all wildlings ...Hun male over 15 of age were killed in the counter attack deep into the north.   All remaining huns retreated westward.     The same records claimed these retreating huns eventually reached middle east and Europe...somewhere around Turkey.  And they owned everyone there.   Their number were few, it is propbably how huns were assimilated into local population once they reached middle east and Europe.  The Great Wall you see today was repaired and rebuilt during Ming Dynasty around 1300 to 1600s to defend aganist the Mongols.

That means, it exists for more than 2,000 years. In the beginning, the Great Wall is used to defend ancient Nomads Of The North. At present, the Wall is a symbol construction of China, just like pyramid to Egypt, Eiffel Tower to France, the Statue of Liberty to US.  2. Ancient China has its own myth system, and most were record in literature. One of the most popular is the Shan Hai Jing (山海经）. Gods, immortals, ghosts and monsters are  included in this book. So, the queen monster in this movie is called Tao Tie, is just a small one.  There is no metaphor in this movie. No Trump, no Mongolians, no Mexican. And, there is no super hero with super power.

I see a lot of people talking about whitewashing but from what I saw it looks like Matt Damon isn't playing a character that's supposed to be Chinese. He's playing a character that came to China to try and get rich and happened to stumble into a war and decided to stay and help. That being said the movie itself looks like a typical fantasy action film that actually looks interesting.

The cinematography and special effects are breathtaking and every scene is so full of details, and the story's been told beautifully from the start to the end. The plot is simple, but the way it is presented is definitely unlike what you think. The pacing's also well structured for an action fantasy film like this IMO. I initially was skeptical about watching this due to bad reviews and how underwhelming the trailer looked but since it's directed by Zhang Yimou, the same genius who directed the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games' opening ceremony, which was a visual spectacle, plus many other great movies in the past, I had faith in it and thankfully, it did not disappoint at all.

A movie cost millions of dollars to produce, this one in particular $150 million. The people that invested that money want their money back and some profit for the risk they took, so they want as many people as humanly possible to go to the movie and spend their $$   Most people go to see a movie not for the movie but cause of the actor that is in the movie. They know that if Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington or Mat Damon is in a movie it is going to be good cause these people are stars and they do not sign up for crappy movies.      If you select  Yang Yang an actor that only a few people outside china know you are going to get a ton of people that are not going to go cause the movie lacks a know star on it. No only that you can go to Zimbabwe and ask  who Mat Damon is and they are going to know, they know he is a good actor, the guys is globally famous... do the same with Yang Yang and tell me what the result will be. No one knows who the fuck he is.     You have to understand movies are made to MAKE MONEY  not for social causes or social justice.

""The Great Wall"" was a surprise all the way to finish. I could never actually imagine it would be THIS good. The acting was great, the visuals were amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, the action were incredible and Jing Tian's beauty was totally stunning. There were several times  I was on the edge of my seat holding breath anticipating the next moment. I really don't remember myself feeling such an amount of excitement during the movie for a long time and it was obvious that everyone who was watching it in the cinema with me felt the same. Overall, I would rate it 9/10, minus point for the running time - it's way too short lol. For everyone who is considering whether to watch this movie or not - ignore the noise of negative people. Let them get sick with their views. Give ""The Great Wall"" a chance and enjoy it to the fullest! Just like what the characters said : ""Trust""! My personal recommendation would be to watch it in 3D/IMAX and Dolby Atmos sound if possible for even better experience :)",1,0,Mark K.,avF6GHyyk5c,0.21316326530612248,2017-02-17 14:09:11,False,True
