I also think the action looks clearer, and is more creative and ambitious than previous trailers put on.  I guess I'll just have to accept the fact that I'll never like Gal Gadot's acting. She still seems super wooden, but the actual lines she's saying are fine. That rock song in the background sounds a lot like a Fall-Out Boy cover of Uprising by Muse, to me. I love that song, but this soundtrack still doesn't really suit the tone. I think they need some background music echoing a classic sword-and-sandals epic.

Not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her she's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, GAL GADOT LOOKS LIKE *THAT*?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in South Korea. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her ""statuesque (for that is what she calls herself)"" beauty, the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months. And then the director calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Sung Kang. You're not going to lose your future political career over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.",0,0,tiger cub,VSB4wGIdDwo,-0.13869648869648868,2017-05-08 18:15:28,True,True

Why  BVS didn't done enough business beacause of this thing & u guys are repeating same mistake again & again. I hope this doesn't happen with Justice League.

I hope it is really good. Justice league is next and WB needs to knock that shit out of the fucking park. Then Aquaman is next, and I have no doubt that my man Kal Drago will Awesome in that movie. WB Ik you guys want to put another movie for 2018. Please don't it 2017 already no point on making a movie for the next year when you don't have anything made yet for it. If flash already as a good script or even a screen writ, fuck it make the movie, but if you guys don't have anything that's ready 2018 besides Aquaman, then don't rush the movie out for the next year. Anyway that's all I have to say. I'm really feeling the goosebumps in this trailer and I watched it about 10 times. Definitely my favorite trailer for this movie, I can't wait for it to come out. Please be good, please be good. I really hope this movie will prove to the public that the DCEU has a chance. Also who tf said Man of steel wasn't good or that it didn't have a huge impact on the DCEU!!! Fucking love that movie definitely helped start the DCEU big time.

2017-05-10T11:39:34,"People who think Wonder Woman is a feminist or LGBT figure are out of their freakin minds. The character was written back in the deep XX centry when feminism was considered laughable and LGBT illegal. She is not resembling a ""progressive"" figure in any way. She is oversexualised, running into war with most of their body exposed, in some comics basically in their panties and bra, nothing more. Oversexualised feminist? That's an oxymoron. Not to mention she always dates either Batman or Superman - in this case Batman I suppose - so she is not just oversexualised but also straight... which discludes LGBT propaganda as well. I guess people call her a feminist agenda because... she is just a woman who fights? That's really not enough for me. Especially that there is a background to that whole fighting thing, it's not like the message is - every girl dreams of fighting bad guys just like boys do! - it's more like - this particular girl likes kicking ass, because she was raised to be a fighter by Amazons. As far as I can tell, there is NO agenda behind this character. So please people, stop being douchbags and just enjoy the film.",14,9,Adam Adamowicz,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.011274509803921584,2017-05-10 11:39:34,True,True

2017-05-30T19:24:52,"Wonder Woman is currently at 97% with 52 critic reviews at Rotten Tomatoes. I think it may  end up as being the highest-rated superhero movie of all time - i.e., higher than any MCU movie.  Marvel Studios seriously dropped the ball when Kevin Feige to  fire  Patty Jenkins as the director of Thor 2: The Dark World.  (So I suppose Wonder Woman can be considered as  Patty Jenkins' personal revenge against Marvel Studios for firing her.)  Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman, Joss Whedon joining (and may be taking over) Warner Bros' DC Extended Universe, and the departure of the incompetent Zack Snyder - those three events may be the turning point for DCEU.  WB has gotten three lucky breaks in quick successions.    Let see if WB will capitalize on those breaks.  If WB is smart, they better quickly lock up Patty Jenkins before Marvel has a chance to correct its mistake and rehire her.  WB needs talents to helm the DCEU, real talents like Whedon and Jenkins, not the talentless hack Zack Snyder that has ruined Superman.",9,3,KT Chong,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.11091269841269841,2017-05-30 19:24:52,False,True

But I can honestly say, even after the ""hype"" of seeing it had worn down, it is one of my new favourite superhero films. Its actually pretty breathtaking and it gave me goosebumps in the trenches scene, because I was like, ""Holy shit. Thats Wonder Woman"". Sure it has its faults, Gal Gadot is still learning acting i would say, and the third act is a little hasty on an otherwise extremely well paced film. But is such a breath of fresh air in the DCEU. Has the ""dark"" tone that i personally don't mind, but then has the intelligence to lighten it up with levity before it descends too dark, like BvS.

Keady’s JJ McParland in LA where she has met up with Hollywood movie studio  bosses.BRITAIN'S Got Talent star Jesse Jane McParland is on the verge of  becoming a star of the big screen.   Since the 10 year-old burst unto our screens in the last series of BGT millions of people around the world have witnessed her extraordinary talent.  And now studio bosses in LA are desperate to get JJ signed up to star in the movies. The Keady girl, along with her dad Gary enjoyed an all-expenses-paid trip to La La Land last week to meet with a major Holywood studio. The pair were joined on the trip by JJ's management team of Brooke Kinsella and Brian Gersh and while they are keeping tight-lipped for now it's understood major developments are in  the pipeline very soon. It's been a whirlwind time for Jesse Jane since her Britain's Got Talent appearances.    Millions of people around the world have viewed the online videos of her competitions, she has been in constant demand for public appearances and has even appeared on the Ellen Show. On top of this she has received numerous offers from major advertising agencies to front national campaigns for a host of different products.   But despite all of these distractions JJ has remained completely focused on her martial arts and just last month won another world title in the Tae Kwon Do championships in Birmingham. For JJ the buzz has always been about competing and she remains absolutely committed to the sport she loves.  She has won practically everything there is to win in the martial arts world and her next major target must surely be a gold medal at the Olympic Games - although that is likely to be eight years away. Although with the attention she has been receiving from Holywood, the world is literally her oyster. If the  signals coming out of Holywood are correct we will be seeing JJ in a major blockbuster movie before we see her competing at the Olympics.

2017-06-11T02:17:48,"Wonder Woman is my favorite superhero along side another superhero. I grew up loving her, reading about her, reading her comics, buying her toys, etc. I LOVE WONDER WOMAN! She is such an incredible, empowering, and influential character in not only comics, but peoples lives. Wonder Woman will always be my favorite superhero along side another as I said.  And I am happy to say that GAL GADOT IS AMAZING AS WONDER WOMAN/DIANA! I LOVE HER AS WONDER WOMAN! She is literally the ideal person for this role and is exactly what Wonder Woman should be. She will go down as a superhero icon, and will join Heath Ledger, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as someone who cannot be replaced for their legendary Super Hero performances aaand portrayls! Not only is she drop dead gorgeous....like I mean really, really beautiful, enchanting, adorable, cute, funny, naive and oh my God sexy, she is the badass WW that we all wanted to see. She kicks so much ass in such a sexy and attractive way, that leaves all the men, and women, in the audience in aww. I was smiling and cheating every time she was on screen because an is so amazing! Iam so damn happy DC and Gal got Diana/Wonder Woman right. Gal is just perfect as WW. Now as for the film we all know DC has not been so fresh on movies lately, and with a major disappointment of Suicide Squad, I was incredibly worried about the film Wonder Woman, and that theu were going to mess her and Gal Gadot up with underwheming directions. I had a nerve wreck going through me for this film. I saw all the hard work Gal, Patty, and the cast was putting in and thought it would all go to waste. I did not know what to expect. Well than I saw the film and may I say I LOVED IT! Iam incredibly honored and happy to say that I really loved this film, and that finally DC did something right. Let me start off by saying that the film was extremely fun and unique. The colors, visuals, and scenery was BEAUTIFUL and pleasing to lay your eyes on. The way the movie looked was just gorgeous and had a fresh escape from all the dark stuff we have been getting from DC. The islands, oceans, London, warzones, make up and costumes, the greenary,  the grittiness....Gal Gadot😏😌😋 Everything was really well done, and you can tell they paid a lot of attention to detail and the new and unique world they were shaping. The action was superb and had an exciting atmosphere that created a very fun and crazy tone. The style of action and fighting really brought another mostly fresh and needed take and door opening to the DC Cinematic Universe. The best action of course comes from Diana, and ot was so satisfying to see her fliping around, jumping through building, blocking bulletts and missles, using her sword and shield, using that laso, doing crazy tricks, and staring into the camera with that arousing yet deadly, ""You are going to get your add kicked"" look! A lot of expolosions, guns, missles, punching, fights, badass action sequences, and more was included in the film, and man was it awesome! But to me where the film really shines is in the characters, well the main stars I should say. I did not expect the film to be so emotional and depressing, and how hard hitting certain moments and scenes were throughout the film, mostly at the end. People were crying and sobbing, and you hear and see everyone in a upset state of mind. Yes the movie was extremely fun with it's action and Gal Gadot's awesome fighting, but where it lies is how well two of the characters were developed. GREAT JOB TO THE MAIN CAST! GAL GADOT AND CHRIS PINE WERE AMAZING!(I cannot remember the other actors and actresses name).YOU ALL DID GREAT! Most character within the film fleshes out, and has their own time to shine and show their developement. Some come off way better than the rest however. Throughout the film, you bond with the Diana and Steve and really see their emotional and human side, which leaves the audience in tears and saddness, especially Wonder Woman herself. Steve Trevor was great and really added a human element to the film, and shows why people love him so much. You cannot hate him because he is so likeable and funny, and adds so much to the film every time he is on screen. He is just a good man and normal man at thay, who is seeing some crazy things, and the way he reacts to those situations and Diana is not only funny, but also believable and heartwarming. As soon as he steps on screen, the film goes up some notches and he does great (especially his chemistry with Diana/Gal Gadot which is another topic). Both provided great humor to the movie, but also grew as a character as well. Diana went from a mysterious, naive, and completely foeign woman, to an understanding, aware, amd even depressed woman who is in the middle of a war trying to realize what is going on. She shows a soft side of her throughout the film, but her emotional side really shows when an is with Steve, especially towards the end and this is actually my favorite part of the film. I have to say it, I just have to..DIANA AND STEVE WERE BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT TOGETHER! The two were adorable every time they interacted, which was often, and this made Diana seem even more so innocent, relatable, attractive, adorable, and emotional. Their chemistry is just amazing, and you really feel the connection and love between them. The moment they laid eyes on each other, you felt a spark to the two attractive beings. They were funny together yes, and this added more of a ""cute"" and likeable aspect to the film, but their enotional scenes together were so uplifting and caring, that the whole time you were wishing they would end up together. You can tell that Diana as soon as she saw Steve, even though she had never encountered with a man, fell in love amd felt a spark. The two were amazing together and their chemistry showed it. They are perfect for each other and I do not know about you guys, but Steve is one lucky man to be loved so much by Diana/Wonder Woman like that. Like he is a really, really, really lucky man(especially because it is Gal Gadot😍😍). The two really stood out and got the most development. I really cannot explain how much emotion and humanity that they gave the film together, and separately. You feel for Diana and you see her suffering and pain. All that she is trying to do is help the innocent and be a good person. An has so much loc and care for the world and is doing her absolute best to save everyone in the world, but she realizes that she cannot, and she hates it. She cries, she screams, and she regrets constantly because every time she does something good, it all turns around and turns into something evil and hurts her. To see her going through that was painful, and I really felt that. But every scene that were in that had your eyes watery and has you depressed because you really got to see the side of themselves you would never have thought you would see like that. I LOVED THEM IN THE FILM! THE whole audience would gasps, cry, and aww the two And oh man they have some of the best, and saddest scenes in the movie and imo comic book movie history(the last sequence). Besides the positives the film does have things holding it back. The villans were terrible sadly. They were cheesy, pathetic, boring, and even cringe worthy at times. I understand they did not want to concentrate on them too much, because Diana and her relationship with Steve were the main focus on the story, but the villans could have been wayyyyyy better. The Climax, while still being loads of fun and filled with emotion, was a bit unoriginal and a ""light show"" if you will. However I still loved the final fight scene due to its emotion and action because it was done so well, and really hit me hard. I thought that her and Steves' crew was too and they were a nice addition to the film, but the Native American one, Chief, was not a good addition to me because he was so bland and boring. But all in all I FRICKIN LOVED WONDER WOMAN! I recommend everyone to go check this movie out, if you weren't going to already for some reason😕. If your a comic book fan or movie fan, this movie will blow your hearts away and satisfy you. I LOVED WONDER WOMAN! A great film that anyone can love. Great Job to the cast of Wonder Woman for the great marketing, promoting, interviews, merchandise, hype, and overall great movie. Thank you DC for finally, after such a long time, for making an amazing movie, and not screwing up my favorite superhero (along side Spider-Man of course). 9/10🌟⭐⭐👍👍💫⭐🌟👍✴✴💥✴💥💥✴👑👑✴💥👍⭐⭐⭐💫⭐💙❤☺😭😱💜💛💚💓💔💕💖💖👀👽👾👌👏🌸🌹🌸🌹🌹🌼🌻🌸🌹🌲🌳🌳🌹🌹🌻🌹🌞🌝🌚🌚💍💎💫💫💥💥",0,0,Ernesto Guidos,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.26960855996741184,2017-06-11 02:17:48,False,True

Chris pine is excellent as steve trevor, David Thewlis is great as ares and the rest of the cast is amazing. i like how this movie show how strong women can be but it also does not make the men weak either. the story is great, the acting is amazing, special effects are great, fight scenes are amazing and the music is awesome especially when you hear her theme song come on and guys when you see her for the first time in the wonder woman outfit don't let you're wife/girlfriend catch you drooling cause damn!. i hope gal gadot plays her for a while hope there will be a trilogy. i'm glad to say that i'm pleased with this movie it's everything i wanted a wonder woman movie to be. just think of it this way imagine the animated movie dc did of her a couple years back live that is what this is. i applaud you dc please do this to the rest of you're films. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do rating 5/5",1,0,David Smith,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.4167301089714883,2017-06-12 09:26:59,False,True

There are simply higher expectations of women than there are for men appearance-wise in this society. Why does wonder woman have to wear considerably less clothing than her male counterparts to show off her body and no one will watch an ugly, clunky wonder woman so they have to put a graceful beautiful woman to play the part. But if it's a male superhero no one cares about his appearance. Not to mention the intended audience of this film. For many men, this film basically fulfills their fantasies and I bet the audience will be mostly men. Most girls don't even watch superhero movies to begin with or like this style of gaining power. So in the end, this type of movie caters to men and their desires. It is the same with video game females who wear revealing clothing even if they may have considerable power. It's for men who like powerful, sexy females. Then after they watch the movie, they can buy her doll as they fap to fantasies of her and make her naked on the internet. In the end, she will be seen more like a sex symbol than as the first female hero.

2017-06-17T04:36:26,"I just saw the movie. I am... disappointed that it wasn't as good as it should have been. Wonder Woman deserves a movie that isn't so mediocre, and a better actress than Gal Gadot. Everything from the boring script, to the tedious pacing, to the ridiculously Mary Poppinsish old gentleman version of Aries, was just lackluster at best, and plain bad at worst. The change to WWI instead of the original comics version of WWII had promise, but it was executed with a stale resentment of it's own purpose. It felt both slow and muddled, and I often had the impression that the only actor who was even trying in their role was the guy playing Steve Trevor. This is the kind of movie that coasts on it's expectations rather than delivering on those expectations. It's also the kind of movie that is completely forgotten in 3 or 4 years. As a proud fan of the Wonder Woman character and stories in comics and animation, I am dumbfounded at how poor her first live-action major motion picture turned out. It's really bad enough that I would recommend the animated Wonder Woman movie from a few years back over it.

2017-06-21T04:14:19,"I sincerely loved this film. There's such an intangible emotional aspect of this film that only a female director with a female lead can produce. This movie reminded me of Disney movies - how simple the terms like ""justice"" and ""righteousness"" actually are, and Wonder Woman, because she's so new to this world, serves to remind us of that in ways that Clark Kent never could. I watched Man of Steel and thought it was a wonderful film, but there's so many extra emotions that Superman simply could not capture because he was such a symbol of male strength, and we place an emphasize on gender roles in ways that actually limit the character development of Superman. This film captures and fills the emotional holes that Zack Snyder couldn't cover in Man of Steel in my opinion. In a whole - excellent sets, fantastic cast, very good, simple, clean (unlike Batman v superman) script, and top notch choreography done in a way that's way more believable than Kill Bill, (partially because of the training, and Gal's background in the military). Just a fantastic film - everyone should go see it! Celebrate women, and the fact that girls everywhere have a superhero film that they can be proud of. There's just aspects of this film that in the larger context, will mean so much more 10 or 20 years from now, (I.e. Having a majority female cast, having a female director and a female lead, having women doing awesome action scenes that look amazing choreography wise) it's just exciting to have been there when it happened.",0,0,realm316,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.26098854397634885,2017-06-21 04:14:19,False,True

2017-06-30T19:15:26,Despite a few critical points like the use of some CGI in the wrong places where it wasn't necessarily needed this movie was a much better DC movie. The best yet. It was good with a decent balance between action and exposition and character moments. The relationship between the two lead rolls felt genuine and was giving time to develop more so then in past DC movies or other superhero movies in general. Remember Clark Kent developing feelings for Louis Lane?? Yeah I missed those scenes as well. The moments are not forced in Wonder Woman. There are also a lot of scenes where they have lifted that moody grey skies post film filter and added color however that being said it does tend to loose that color as the film goes on and does start to suffer a bit having to squint to see what's going on. It isn't that bad but you get the point. The colorful nature of the movie worked perfect and could have been applied to the remainder of the movie. Stop making every DC movie like I'm watching it through a dirty darkened window. Color is okay. Not too positive how I feel about the main villain. Are we saying he is responsible for all war and fighting?? Does that mean all the criminal activity in Gotham and Metropolis is caused by this villain?? There are possible writing holes here. That aside it is an entertaining funny movie that you will have a great time watching. Hire that director again and maybe put less limitations on her and give you movies more color and make them more accurate to the characters.,0,1,Kevin W.

Nobody is talking about feminism in this trailer and this trailer have a lot more likes than dislikes, not like the Ghostbusters women movie, Why? because is not about men are better than woman, is about Don't make shit movies!!! and worse: don't came with your shit over a well done classic movies.   2nd: I loved this WW movie, Was great!!! like many people, I think this will be a shit like the lastest DC Movies but this movie is great! except for that stupid intro to this flashback history about WW in Paris and the stupid Wayne Industries's Van, Who cares that? is nothing important for the movie, another thing... Spoiler... The final airplane scene fix well with all the movie, is a big scene for the ending but... like the rest universe of Zack Snyder´s Justice league, don't have logic, LOGIC DAMN IT!!! Adult LOOOOGIC!!! in relation with cinematographic maturity... I mean: why he die??? why he didn't try to live? I mean if you want to kill one character you put him in ""no way situation to came out alive"" and that is easy, maybe he don't find any parachute because is a suicide mission or something but... let me tell you what I would do in his place: would take the plane very high (like he did), then I run the plane horizontally, I search for a parachute, I go to the door, while I jump I shoot my gun to the poisson tanks and then maybe I live, maybe I die but at least I try!!!   You don't find everyday the most Wonderful Woman in the world, then she fall in love with you, you kiss her and 24 hours later you pretend to be a hero and decides to die as one!!! Nooo, you fight as a heroe for live with her because you know that you deserve to live and you going to fight for that.

In some movies I like that, but in this one, not so much. The pacing for me was just... off. Plus I wasn't sold on Chris Pine as Steve.

So I think you should just leave it and have Diana use her shield, the sword prevents her from doing some pretty badass stuff which I would love to see happen. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but the sword makes the fight scenes so much worse and it's unneeded. Also too much slow motion. Play everything quick so that people can't get the chance to comprehend how amazing the fight scenes are because they're so great. Slow motion just isn't a go. Could just be my opinion. But overall, I say hang up the sword. The shield is such a better choice alone, I mean look at captain America, I literally cannot breathe every time he fights someone on screen, can't wait to see their ass get whooped, and I'd love to see Wonder Woman bring that same feeling. Lastly she needs to use her surroundings more to help her fight don't just rely on your defense, and close range combat is great too",1,2,Cedric Central,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.1932017543859649,2017-07-14 05:06:54,False,True

This movie has very strong message that I loved, and it's not only about finding your power and being a woman. The main theme is about humans and their internal choices. There are no Gods who make humans act destructive, kill, or start wars. No God of war has control over those who fight in the war, (even in this fantasy plot Ares gave ideas of deadly gas, but humans were the ones choosing to create it) only their own dark side feeds their actions. Everything is a choice that one makes between light and dark. I hope that this world does deserve their own wonder women.",32,1,Olha Paige,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.19875,2017-07-17 06:46:37,False,True

At best it has a few refreshing moments because of Diana's gender and upbringing, but apart from that it is a pretty standard super hero movie. You literally see everything coming and the christian themes are really obvious as well. Well the storyline isn't bad but it isn't special either, it is the same ""you see the darkness in humans and almost despair and then change your mind"" story you have seen over and over and not even handled differently. Also, ""Ares"" is clearly just the devil, no doubt about it, and not even a well written one. And the whole thing how the Brits and Americans are portrayed... the same cowardice I came to expect from superhero movies. In fact, the big bad guy is some evil British guy... this is standard US villain stereotype. I heard so much about the lack of male gaze and all but what is so different about this simply because it is directed by a woman? What would have been different in the movie if it was a man who directed it? In fact what is so special about it apart from the fact that director and leading star are women?

2017-09-28T02:24:54,Authenticity - most people commenting here are much younger than I am.  Three comments: 1.  Germans being viewed as enemy is not Hollywood.  DC Wonder Woman was developed in 1940-41.  Germans were enemy from Great War and WW2 was raging at the time. 2.  Gal Gadot being a bad actress actually fit in with Diana being naive when being first exposed to humans. 3.  Movie is pretty much to DC script except Black Amazonian Warriors.

2017-09-29T05:33:44,"This movie will be much more better without the stupid amount of slow motion scene that ( I presune ) is the influence of Zack Snyder.  Gal Gadot portrayal of Wonder Woman as “ A fish out of water “ fascinated with the world beyond Themiscyra is on point. Her acting skills improved a lot after Fast and Furious franchise. Her chemistry with Chris Pine is lovely and believable  I just rewatched Wonder Woman in digital HD on my iPad and it is much more better the second time you see it  Positive : - Gal Gadot brilliant performance - The chemistry between Gadot and Pine is believable - Light hearted and funny especially when she arrived at London - No man’s land ( Nuff’ said )  Negative : - Overuse of slow motion - The CGI is quite bad at some moment  PS :   For a long time after the success of The Dark Knight trilogy I felt like DC has been going down with the quality of their movies, but Wonder Woman can be the catalyst for their improvement in the DCEU  And I also love Marvel movies, and I hope DC can come back on track as they used to be with The Dark Knight  Peace ✌️",0,0,Twin Bee,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.12041847041847044,2017-09-29 05:33:44,False,False

And where are all the black Amazonian women, and black Nazis (also Asian, Hispanic, Indian, Pakistani, etc.) is this movie racist? I sincerely hope that she is at least a Jewish Amazonian, otherwise it's antisemitic and she should join the Nazis, not fight them,  because she is then worse than Hitler (but much better looking and with bigger breasts). Why are her armpits shaved, is this movie misogynistic? If her vagina is also shaved, which I bet it is, it's definitely misogynistic! Also all these explosions must have generated a lot of carbon dioxide emissions, don't you know about global warming? Stop killing our planet, you racist bigots! And why is she not fat like a pig, is this movie against fat liberation? And did she even choose her gender in the movie? Wake up people, it's current year!

Wonder Woman's mother tried to keep her from that life and her Aunt said,""a scorpion must Sting, a wolf must hunt."" Guns are the modern weapon for self defense.

It reminds me who evil really is and how easy it is to become that judgmental and I back down from my anger seat and bathe in compassion for humanity. It's more than a movie to me! I have the outfit and a sword too! :) Everyone should watch it multiple times and get the message and the world would change.

Good script,director and effects as well.  Batman vs Superman was aaaaalmost on the same level. Very nice touch at the end of the movie with Doomsday. Also good casting,not so good like Superman,but c'mon...FINALLY a Batman who looks BIG. At least compare to Christian Bale who looked  more than patetic with those tiny shoulders and 1,70 height....even Alfred was taller then him 😂 But this here....no words. First-The movie director. Can you please STOP changing the power of W.W. She penetrate concrete wals with her almost naked body,but somehow 38cal.is waaaay to much for her ?!! The main villian. What is his super-hero name,BoringMan ? 😁 Add to all this almost a home computer level efects and average script. And one more thing ☝ This is action movie. It's based on comics books. Less talking,LESS drama❗ MORE action  ❗❗❗ Avengers,Guardians of the Galaxy 1,2,Thor-Ragnarock....THIS is the corect formula. But this right here is bad. But don't worry.

I will bring you some news from it; or bring you a firebrand, that you may warm yourselves.” ٨  فَلَمَّا جَاءَهَا نُودِيَ أَنْ بُورِكَ مَنْ فِي النَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ8  Then, when he reached it, he was called: “Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He who is around it, and glorified be God, Lord of the Worlds.  ٢٣  إِنِّي وَجَدْتُ امْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ وَأُوتِيَتْ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ23  I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given of everything, and she has a magnificent throne. ٢٤  وَجَدْتُهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لَا يَهْتَدُونَ24  I found her and her people worshiping the sun, instead of God. Satan made their conduct appear good to them, and diverted them from the path, so they are not guided. ٢٥  أَلَّا يَسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي يُخْرِجُ الْخَبْءَ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ25  If only they would worship God, who brings to light the mysteries of the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. ٢٦  اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ ۩26   God—There is no god but He, the Lord of the Sublime Throne.” ٢٧  قَالَ سَنَنْظُرُ أَصَدَقْتَ أَمْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الْكَاذِبِينَ27  He said, “We will see, whether you have spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar. ٢٨  اذْهَبْ بِكِتَابِي هَٰذَا فَأَلْقِهْ إِلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ فَانْظُرْ مَاذَا يَرْجِعُونَ28  Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them; then withdraw from them, and see how they respond.” ٢٩  قَالَتْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ إِنِّي أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ29  She said, “O Counselors, a gracious letter was delivered to me. ٣٠  إِنَّهُ مِنْ سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ30  It is from Solomon, and it is, ‘In the Name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful. ٣١  أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ31  Do not defy me, and come to me submissively.’”",0,0,Anwar Ali Shaikh,VSB4wGIdDwo,0.35,2019-12-18 11:02:08,False,False
