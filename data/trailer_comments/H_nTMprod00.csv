Horror is my favourite genre but these films are all garbage, go back to the film of the 70's and 80's to see what real horror is. I mean how hard must it be for these horror movie directors, just watch a film like The Shining and follow the same blueprint and you have a REAL horror film. Music, suspense, backstory (optimised through the characters behaviour), fear (it's not all about 2 seconds of jump scare, you need to show the horror for a continues time and make the audience feel the same fear as the character) and so so much more.
