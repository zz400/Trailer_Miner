Unless of course those people had seen the file and copied it. That said the movie explains this by saying ""Nobody understands the cloud"".  - Finally, wouldn't pay to see this, this is Netflix fodder for me.

2014-04-09T08:46:32,"Isn't it strange how movies nowadays can't seem to be interesting or even sell tickets without being morally debased? If this is really the low that America must sink to to entertain a group of perverts, it truly is a depressing sight. And if me, a 15 year old boy, who should be glorifying sex by the media's stereotypical view of teenagers can see this. Why can't anyone else seem to? THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE IS EUPHEMISM FOR A PORNOGRAPHY FILM! And it's not a good one either. I'm honestly disgusted by this and we as a society should be too. This is nothing but an insult to intelligence and only plays on males sex drive. Which by the way, makes us make dumb decisions in the first place. Almost as dumb of a decision as whomever decided this should be a plot for a movie! If we ever want to make a move towards a more civilized and complex society where people can be happy and productive, we need to do away with such debased filth. All this is a lie. Sex is not like this. This is not what sex is about everyone. But we seem to have forgotten that through our glorification of pornography. Also don't think that I'm writing this essay on morals because I'm some church hopping bible jockey, I'm writing this in pure shock that such a premise for a film could actually be released and advertised. They try to cover it up with jokes and even heavy drug use! Seriously cocaine use? I'm done. Just done. If this is really what we call entertainment, I'll be in my pillow fort watching Tom and Jerry in my pajamas. Alone. Not snorting crack, or making a ""Sex Tape"". Fuck this.

If the person who received the iPad set it up themselves, which seems much more likely, shouldn't the iPad by synced to just their own cloud, not Annie and Jay's? Each cloud is meant to be associated with your own Apple ID, so unless Annie and Jay authorised the iPads to connect to their cloud using their ID, how would this premise of everyone getting their sex tape even work?

I was so wrong !  The trailer is great but i found out that the jokes in the trailer were the only ones in the entire movie. It wasn't funny, it wasn't even sexy, just foolish and childish. The actors were fine, (the truth is, in general, i love them both) but the plot was horrible. The movie was boring and it had some unnecessary parts which really pissed me off. I was so frustrated, i can believe i paid to see this movie; sincerely, i was mad on myself too, because i was so sure it was going to be a great movie, but it wasn't even close.

Most movies like his get bad reviews because of they type of crowd watching them can not relate to them, like this movie here you have to be married for a while and positive about being married to get it. And what I mean by understand is funny or a few funny parts. Never expect a comedy to funny all the way threw it. Its just not possible if that were the case then you would have most funniest movie in history made every years just not possible like I said all you can expect is for there to be a few funny parts and hope you dont get board half way there it. Anything else, well then you get a surprise movie. I think this is whats wrong with people now days they think because it says comedy that its going to be non stop laughing, thats about like you thinking that you are going to win the lottery every time you play it.

2015-03-04T15:30:33,"Yet another example of the reaffirmation of the totally false belief which has nonetheless long been the normative view especially in the developed world, that sex exists for some purpose other than reproduction.  The reason that your ""sex life"" begins to decline as you age, the reason that you don't have any libido anymore, grandpa, is that is the way that it is supposed to be!!!  When women especially age beyond a certain point, it becomes less and less healthy for them to have children, until they lose the ability to do so altogether.  Men's testosterone levels begin declining at a relatively young age.  The reason you have all manner of hindrances in having the ""kind of sex you used to"" is that you are past your reproductive prime!!  In spite of this, multitudes of dupes persist in the belief that the health of their marriages is tied intrinsically to the ""passion"" between they and their spouses.  Wake the fuck up!!!  This is one of the multitudinous perversions of the natural way of things which have been interjected and portrayed as normative by the aberrant anomalies among mankind who have always sought to pervert nature in conformity to their will, despite the tragic and permanent consequences that their forebears wrought upon mankind in pursuit of that selfsame goal. They have been known by many names, but it is useful and convenient to simply refer to them as the “progressive” agenda. Other names which are somewhat beneficial for explanatory purposes are “sons of Cain”, which has been applied by deceptive persons in the past whose intent was to further an agenda. These portrayed the sons of Cain, defined by self-determination and reliance upon and even exaltation of their own ability, while those portrayed as antithetical to them are called by such persons the sons of Seth, by which they mean the “churchmen” who are portrayed as using religion to control people. This terminology would be accurate and supremely useful if not for the fact that it is unclear and for many reasons even highly doubtful that there is any legitimate conflict between the heads of organized religion and the “self-reliant” “progressives”. In fact there is strong evidence that they are secretly in alliance with each other, with the inner core of both factions being comprised of committed amoral “progressives”.",0,1,MELEKH HA OLAM,eJTct8eHKYE,-0.00952211850649351,2015-03-04 15:30:33,False,False
