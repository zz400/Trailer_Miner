The cringe aspect of the whole setting will still exist, but at least they are trying to make it original and a little bit charming. Don't go into this movie with a mindset of trying to find the cringe, try to watch it from an actual storytelling and movie perspective. I am not trying to praise, I'm just saying put down the cringe for now, because we haven't seen the whole movie yet, and at least hope for a decent movie.

A character who has to play a specific role but wants to be more and ends up messing stuff up and going on an adventure with his friends. 3. 0:32 This freaking unfunny joke. 4. 1:02 This freaking hipster girl is wearing a winter scarf on a perfectly sunny day. 5. 1:15 What the heck kind of emoji is that. Bright hair beanie emoji? The heck is with that stupid pixel skull thing on it.  6. The fact that this exists. 7. 1:20 A reference to an outdated meme. The creators seem to not realize that memes these days have very short life spans. Back in the mid 2000s, memes had very long life spans. Things like CDi cutscenes, Pepe the frog, those poorly drawn faces made to represent emotion, etc. Those were made at a time before things like ""Behind the Meme,"" a channel which tries to introduce Normies to meme culture, but by doing that, makes memes have way shorter life spans, from 2 weeks to, at most, 2 months. 'Bye Felicia' may have been relevant when the script was made, but due to the creators' lack of knowledge on meme life spans, the movie is outdated before its even released. Imagine 20 years from now, the new generation wouldn't have a freaking clue what 'bye felicia' is. Sorry for going on this giant rant on meme life spans, but that scene made me genuinely want to punch a wall from how stupid it was. 8. 1:30 Making us endure 10 seconds of an unfunny joke. 9. The fact that the joke from number 8 will probably go on for longer than 10 seconds in the movie. 10. The fact that this exists for the third time. 11. 1:41 Forced love story. 12. 1:45 What the heck even is that. You mean to tell me that there are whales made of code in our phones? Or is this just a stupid impossibility made so there is a romantic scene. 13. 1:55 There is a Just Dance type game scene in this movie. 14. 1:59 Candy Crush. 15. 2:09 This unfunny joke. 16. The fact that this exists for the fourth flipping time. 17. THE. 18. FACT. 19. THAT. 20. THIS.  21. EXISTS.

2017-05-22T00:58:33,"People experience emotional and mental health crises in response to a wide range of situations—from difficulties in their personal relationships to the loss of a job. For Veterans, these crises can be heightened by their experiences during military service. When emotional issues reach a crisis point, it’s time to call on the Veterans Crisis Line for support.  Sometimes a crisis may involve thoughts of suicide. Learn to recognize these warning signs:  Hopelessness, feeling like there’s no way out Anxiety, agitation, sleeplessness, or mood swings Feeling like there is no reason to live Rage or anger Engaging in risky activities without thinking Increasing alcohol or drug abuse Withdrawing from family and friends The following signs require immediate attention:  Thinking about hurting or killing yourself Looking for ways to kill yourself Talking about death, dying, or suicide Self-destructive behavior such as drug abuse, weapons, etc. If you are a Veteran or know a Veteran who is experiencing any of these signs, call the Veterans Crisis Line immediately. Responders are standing by to help.  You can also learn to identify and understand risk factors for suicide.  Identifying the Signs  Many Veterans may not show any signs of intent to harm themselves before doing so, but some actions can be a sign that a Veteran needs help. Veterans in crisis may show behaviors that indicate a risk of harming themselves.  Learn more about how you can identify additional signs of suicide risk.  Take a Self-Check Quiz  Crisis, stress, depression, and other issues affect people in different ways. Maybe you’re having trouble sleeping or feel out of control. Maybe your energy level is down or you feel anxious all the time. If these issues and others seem to be leading to a crisis, treatment can help. Take a confidential, anonymous risk assessment to see how you might benefit from VA or community-based services.",4,1,Maya L,r8pJt4dK_s4,-0.009247234247234249,2017-05-22 00:58:33,True,True

2017-05-22T17:52:58,"People are upset because Illumination, Sony, and possibly Dreamworks (which was bought by the owner of Illumination) could possibly be setting a trend in animated movies that is for the worse. Instead of creating movies that are thought provoking, beautiful, and have smart humor, these companies are turning to trends and relying on them for their movies rather than trying to create something timeless, which actually takes a lot of time and effort to do.  I personally am scared for the future of animated movies, as movies like these ones may seem simple and harmless, but they're creating more money than companies that actually try to bring quality entertainment, such as Laika and Disney. Secret Life of Pets, which is basically a horrid fusion of Toy Story and animal videos on YouTube, made 233.3 million more than Disney's Moana.  If these companies continue to make mediocre movies that do well in the box office, it's possible that the quality stories and actual effort we see in some animated movies today will completely relinquish, and these movies will rule over the animated movie genre.   There is no heart put in to this film, the character designs took no effort at all because they're based on emojis, and the only reason it's being made is because emojis are what are ""trendy"" with the kids these days.

But in another trailer, Alex's friend tells him to play it cool and send her an emoji. And what emoji does he use to ""play it cool""? You got it, a freaking Meh 😒. We also see that the meh emoji made the wrong face. And then later Alex says to his friend "" I gotta get this phone fixed"" and how does he fix it? By deleting his phone as said by the smiley face girl when she is interrogating the meh in a room. Alex COULD'VE pressed a wrong button and sent the wrong emoji to her, but Alex assumes that the meh just glitched out. We all in our lives have mistaken a word or emoji for another.

They could have done anything else and would have been so much better .. like a movie about a group of humans who lives in a world dominated by evil dragons and an elite class of half dragons, and the god of humanity suddenly gives them  a prophecy to travel to certain place to be free of the Dragons cuz X dumb deus ex Machina, so the movie follows the leader or a group of leaders of humanity making the travel, culminating with an epic fight against one of the dragons, with maybe one or two of the group dying sacrificing themselves. A little alike the Jews escaping the egyptians.  I thought that plot in what 5 minutes ? and it's way better than this movie.

2017-05-30T05:35:44,"I don't get all the hate on this movie. Someone please tell me 5 reasons to hate this movie. Beside the ones mentioned here. Meanwhile, I'm going to try to disprove the most common hates on it. 1. Cliche: There really is nothing wrong with cliche. Some might say, ""its overused"", but that's exactly what cliche is, so explain what's wrong with overused. And it doesn't seem _that_ cliche, anyway. 2. Ripoff: lots of people say it's a ripoff of wreck it ralph and inside out. It really isn't, if you actually pay attention to the trailer. It's true that it has a similar concept to wreck it ralph, but the story isn't exactly the same like some might say. Emoji movie is a story of self discovery, who he is meant to be. Wreck it ralph isn't self discovery, it's a mix of redemption and accepting who you are. And honestly I don't get the relation to inside out. And also, at least it's not like a super cheap ripoff like Great Value off of everything(no offense, but seriously) 3. The Popeye movie: they didn't _popeye_ movie for this. They _delayed_ It. So stop spreading lies! And popeye movie is about an ordinary world, where all the rules are the practically the  same, but it has a guy with spinach powers. I would rather see a movie with a whole new undiscovered world where there's not much insight on what it's about.  Other things  1. Animation is good 2. Story seems at least decent, not as bad as everyone following internet hate says it it. 3. Concept is interesting 4. Humor is meh... gonna be honest 5. Plot is creative and interesting  I know this comment may sound angry but I promise I'm not trying to be mad. And seriously, tell me more reasons why it's bad and why cliche is bad. Honestly I'm not that good of a movie analyzer (yes I know, the above is me analyzing the movie, but that stuff is obvious) so I just want to understand all the hate.",2,2,Jacob Tsou,r8pJt4dK_s4,-0.02215909090909091,2017-05-30 05:35:44,True,True

Why can't it be a budgie film about an emoji trying to find his true self, figuring out he's really not a meh but a exclusive emoji. And can't the hand emoji be a comic relief. And maybe the antagonist could be the parents, for one it could be a twist to the ""find your self"" cliché and could make a really good story about who you should trust.

2017-06-04T18:59:04,"First of all the trailer spoils the whole story, which is bland and uninspired. So much so that I think I can write a better story right now by just making things up. I want to make a movie about a stick man. Like a literal stick man. Like he's made out of sticks. He randomly comes to be in the woods and some kids find him. He has human emotions and learns to talk and eventually starts going to school where (instead of the cliche bullying route where everyone makes fun of him for being different.) He fits in and everyone accepts him despite his uniqueness. But there will still be lots of opportunities for comedy as the stick man does not well understand human behaviors and is disposed to being highly environmental and always wanting to spend time outside. (Though the environmental messages will be troden on carefully and done subtly to avoid preachy fern gully/ James cameron avatar levels of we're drestroying the planet). It can also have a commentary on human relations as the stick man has an outside perspective on people. There I came up with a better story. Where's my 100mil and animation crew?

2017-06-26T07:21:19,"2020: The Movie Movie   It's about a man name Steve who works as a post-production supervisor at SONY(He Hates his job). He has a friend named Michael that wants to be an actor. Michael always gets rejected from many film productions because of his singing. Steve has a crush on an art director named Sara(who will be Steve's girlfriend at the end of the movie). Steve wishes that he could run his own film production and be like his father. His father was once a director and a producer but sadly died. He is frustrated with all of these sh***y movies like The Emoji Movie, Norm of the North, Ghostbusters(2016), the Transformers movies and etc. He learns about a time machine that was invented not to long ago. Steve eventually steals it. So Steve, Michael and Sara go on an adventure to stop the sh***y movies from being made. They also look back on many good movies from many companies like Disney and Dreamworks. Along the way, there being chased be many horrible directors like Michael Bay and Zach Snyder with there evil army of robots(robots made from SONY). Steve will also learn that things will happen and we need to accept it or ignore it. At the climax Michael Bay and Zachary Snyder will die from falling into a pit of lava. Since Steve went backed in time, it affected the space time continuum every single horrible movie never existed. Steve quits his job at SONY and runs his film production. Steve finale gets the girl. He also hires Michael to be an actor in his business. They continuously made a load of great movies. This eventually put SONY out of business.

If ""The Emoji Movie"" came out in 2014 or 2015, it would make a little more sense since that was when emojis were used more in pop-culture.  Now, not really, as the big trends this year are fidget spinners, Ed Sheeran, etc (NO, PLEASE NOT A FIDGET SPINNER MOVIE. HELL NO.)  Same if the Angry Birds movie came out in 2010 or 2011.  I know that animated movies take a few years to make.  So what you should probably do, Sony, is stop making these ""current trend movies"" now.

Even though it's not the best animation like Big Hero 6 or even Cars 3 but I will give it credit for trying to be different but not gonna give it hate since I am trying to look in the bright side and say I might see it and give it a chance cause who knows it might be surprisingly good.,6,0,zσmσk вєαn,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.18461538461538457,2017-07-23 07:26:50,False,True

They lay there quietly, watching outside their windows as their life force fades away.  This same behavior spreads globally, dropping earths population soon into the hundreds. As the numbers drop fast, only one individual remains.  This last young man wakes up, only to find the entire world dead. He sits there, complelty in shock. With his head in his hands, he receives a 'beep' from his phone. Looking up, he grabs it, swipping at the lock screen. Seeing the caption appear, he knows what he must do.  But before he attempts to take his own life, the phone dies. Leaving him in a petrified silence.  He had been watching to much porn the night prior, so his phone battery drained.   As this realization kicks in, he lets out a shout of anger.   ""CURSE YOU PORN HUB!""  The camera pans out of the house, up into the sky, and fades to black.                           *The End*",11,2,pizzama2003,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.03188888888888888,2017-07-27 10:25:22,False,True

You could have done the Popeye film, and i guarantee that it wouldn't have nearly this many dislikes. This movie has more hate than I think Ghostbusters did.

2017-07-29T16:19:16,"The emoji movie is this summers top movie. It follows three main characters, gene, jailbreak and hi-5 as they journey to the cloud. Gene is a special emoji who is gifted with multiple emotions in a world where you can't be different, he meets up with our supporting characters to become what he must be, a meh. They run into many complications and grow as characters.  I don't understand the hate surrounding this movie and frankly I'm insulted and confused why anybody would feel that way, I thought it was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the duration of the film. I enjoyed it incredibly. It was immersing, I related to every character on a deep emotional level, the main character Gene (played by famous actor T J Miller) seemed to grow so much and by the end it was like seeing the achievements of my own child. I loved the strong female character, it was great to see feminism portrayed I such a great way. Hi-5 was so funny and his design was humorous.  Now let me tell you about the plot. This movie was deep, I found myself completely immersed and time seemed to fly. By the end I felt like a different person, this is so much more then a children's movie. I'd recommend to anybody to go see this movie. It seems like it will become a classic like pulp fiction or back to the future in no time. And trust me when I say, I've already got tickets to see it again.   Over all I would give this movie a 9/10 and I'm a pretty tough critic. So make sure you get your tickets now and prepare for the best movie you'll see in a while.

2017-07-30T15:00:09,"I watched this movie and even the kids in the theatre seemed to be bored! So I made a list of OTHER movies you can show young ones, corresponding to reasons you might want to see this one. My rule of thumb: If the movie is too bad for you to sit through, don't show it to kids!   Suggestions: Bright colors and fun visuals: wreck-it-Ralph, Ponyo, The Little Mermaid, Inside Out Things that explore technology that they like: wreck-it-Ralph Funny movies: This'll be different depending on your kids. Different kids have different senses of humour! Try out some Pixar films, find what your kids like. Personally I laughed a lot at Inside Out and Kung Fu Panda Different worlds: wreck-it-Ralph, Cars 1 and 3, Finding Nemo Everyday objects that ARE different worlds: Toy Story General recommendations: Moana, Up, Cats Don't Dance My favorites as a kid: The Iron Giant, Spirited Away, Finding Nemo, 101 Dalmatians, Land Before Time, How To Train Your Dragon  Point being: There are plenty of movies kids will like that don't insult their intelligence! Disney is a good place to start, but look into other ones too; different companies like Studio Ghibli turn out interesting movies that your kids might like to see too. Understand when kids are distracted versus kids having legit fun. Also account for what your kids like!  TIP: The movies I have suggested are not showing in cinemas, but if your kids really love the experience, some cinemas do summer matinee or kids' group showings of Disney films (for reduced prices to boot!). Don't be afraid to ask the local cinema if they do this!   Have a good day!",2,2,Jessi Kamekazi,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.11342592592592593,2017-07-30 15:00:09,False,True

All the emojis live in a world where they can express whatever emotion they want, but every time a human texts and uses an emoji, giant mechanical hands rain down from the sky and grabs however many emojis the human uses for that particular text. The emojis are then forced to make whatever face the human chooses. One rebellious emoji and a few of his friends go out and try to find a way to delete the text and set the emojis free. Little do they know, when they successfully delete all the texts, it just kills the emojis that were attached to them.

It's one things to not like this movie but it's another thing to bring it down like this. I mean have you ever thought how the creators who put this movie together just for us to see feel? I bet if any of the creators saw this much criticism especially one that are harsh they would feel so sad because they worked so hard to try and make you guys happy and yet you guys are showing them that they're work here is not appreciated. Do you guys even know how long it takes to make a movie that is 3D animation? It's takes so long and the way the creators work is whole day repeating the same editing the same filming each day until the movie is perfect. And here is your harsh response to them after they worked so hard to make this movie happen just to make you guys happy and entertain you guys. So the next you wanna criticize any movie because they don't appeal to you or they are don't have plots in your opinion think about the time and effort they put in to make these movie happen! And yes I am 20 and in university and I'm excited for this movie because this looks awesome!,5,28,Yang Yang,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.09681712962962963,2017-08-06 01:31:08,False,True

2017-09-17T15:53:43,"Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

Doesn't it sound ridiculous ? How great it is, that it was subtle, incorporated in the story to MAKE SENSE and not in your fucking face, retarded, completely unreal dialogue ?  Yeah we get it, the girl doesn't want to be a princess, she wants to be a hacker. Great! What's the problem in just exploring the character and have the audience understand her through her actions and feelings instead of, again IN YOUR FUCKING FACE, words that no sensible person says EVER ???

The Internet predicts you will crumble into a thousand pieces.  However, the Internet says that your fall will be slow and agonizing.  There will be 5 Disasters.  The First Disaster will that your movie will be widely hated and the haters' opinions will be spread through a 100 websites, including Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and many more.  The Second Disaster will occur when people will stop buying your products and your TVs will be useless.  The Third Disaster will be when your company splits in half with your animation studio splitting from your network over profits.  The Forth Disaster will be when Sony Pictures Animation shuts down due to bankruptcy and bad, low profitable animated movies like The Emoji Movie.  The Fifth and final Disaster will be when your company shuts down completely, also sharing the same fate as your animation studio.  The Internet says your DOOMED, unless you shut down your animation studio and completely destroy all of it's movies. Leave no remains.   Do not attack or sue me, Sony Pictures Entertainment, I only speak for the Internet.........

Yes this is a movie meant for children but the problem is it is only meant for children. What happened to movies that both parents and children can enjoy like wall-e, Finding Nemo, Toy Story 1,2 and 3 those movies are movies that I can enjoy watching in the cinemas with my kids. During the time I was watching the emoji movie it was clear that the only one that was enjoying the movie was my kid and he's 10 years old.

2017-12-13T02:30:37,"Honestly, people that LOOK at this movie jump the gun and claim that it is bad, when they haven't seen the plot, morale, and theme of the movie including the use of several humour ideas. I do not see why it is a bad movie, I liked it honestly. The movie was easy, a mixture of other movies but related to more tech. The Alpha Generation is going to be in  (I'm the class of 2021, so I don't have some ways to say this,) more use of technology, and that they don't go outside as much as the generation of the 2000 year's. This relates to the movie by presenting the problem, along with qoutes from Ironic characters. The main character Genetically programmed to be a ""Meh"" emoji does not fullfill his purpose, sent into exile, found his true love, able to express other emoji's such as the ""Heart Eyes"" emoji, the shy emoji, etc. In other sense, it is a well rounded movie and created by Sony Pictures Entertainment. It is a good movie showing the theme as ""Express yourself and do not be afraid of limiting yourself because of what other people think."" It is a child's theme but a good one sense it does make it kid friendly. If only the people actually watched the movie, looking it up I have found that 30% of the people who rated it rated it good while the other 70% did not. I can bet my life that more than a 1/4 of that 70% hasn't watched the movie seeing that it is bad from other people. I like the movie and it's use of music, it really did change the main character's perspective. Although it was a 1 hour 31 minute long. If changed to be longer, it will be better to fullfill the character's background. Please take this into consideration because I do not agree with the people who has not watched the movie but claims it's bad in sorts of ways. I like it, and that is my claim.",4,4,Keagan Vang,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.11004273504273505,2017-12-13 02:30:37,False,False

The most important invention in the history of communication! Emojis. That's my home! Textopolis. Here, each of us does one thing, and we have to nail it every time. Christmas tree just has to stand there, all festive. Merry christmas! It's still september, Tim! And princesses... I am so pretty. They just gotta wear their crowns and keep their hair comb. We are so pretty. Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up, they just show up and they're good to go. But for the faces, the pressure is on. Cryer always has to cry, even if he just won the lottery. Hurray, i'm a millionaire! Laugher's always laughing, even if he's just broken his arm. Ahh!! Ah! I can see the bone!! Ah ah ah ah ah... And me, i'm a meh. So I gotta totally be over it all the time, you know? Like meh, who cares. Which is not as easy as it sounds. I gotta be mehhhhhhhhh I GOTTA! Be! Mehhhhhhhhh. Morning, Mrs. D, I see you have the little minis with ya! Oh, they're so... Cute! NYAH, SO ADORABLE, I CAN'T TAKE IT! I WILL NEVER GET THEM TO SLEEP! STICK TO YOUR ONE FACE, WEIRDO. OLE! OLE! OH NO! OH NO! It's hard to only act blasé. When, living in Textopolis is.... Just so exciting! Hello, good simeans! Those are some sharp attaches! Yes, well we have business to attend to. What kind of business? Monkey business. Ha ha ha ha, I sounded british. Meh... Oh, that was really good.. Meh? Meh... Meh ha ha... What the freak ya doing there, mate? Practicing. Today is my first day on the phone. Oh, droit. I'm gonna be so.. Meh. What are you going to do? Blah! Me and the boys are gonna throw ourselves on the barbie! Woo! Puh-zow! Gooday, mate! Hey, konichiwa! Sorry emoticons!! Oh, I hate knocking over the elderly.. Let me help, let me help... Oh, my colon!!! Ducks... Hey, is that the time? HEY, my eyes are up here, pal! Woo ooh hoo! Woo hoo! Right on time! And last week, Alex sent me next to THIS text! Huh? Huh? HA HA HA THAT ELEPHANT PISSED HIMSELF HA HA HA AH HAH HA HAH HAH UH HUH HUH why are YOU laughing, freak? Ho ho ha ha ha! Now, unlike me, my parents are total pros. Gene, please tell me you weren't laughing just now. Gene so help me I swear oh, he was, I remember. Let's go see if you can get it right. I have some bad news, Gene, and i'm afraid that you'll have the wrong reaction. Ok, what's the wrong reaction? Anything other than meh. Come on! I don't want to be late! I'm not letting you go to work today. Wait, WHAT? You're just not ready, son. Come on!! Working in a cube is an Emoji's whole purpose in life! Everybody my age is working on the phone except for me! Oh sweetie, that's not true. Ow! YEAH! I'm going to work on the phone and I'm only ten! That's because I believe in you! Should we wash our hands? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! We're number two! We're number two! See? I, I know i'm different, ok? But, I need to... I can be meh... I just... Want to be a working emoji, you know, like... Everybody else... And then... I would finally fit in, you know? Ah, you fit in, honey. No I don't, mom. I never have. But I could change all that if you just let me! Just give me a chance! But what if you get sent out on the phone, making the wrong face? No dad, i'll make the right face! Look! Meh? You're so handsome when you make that face. I think he's ready, Mel. Meh. Come on, dad. Let me prove it to you. If you really think you're ready... YES! Yes I am! I promise I won't let you down! Wow! Congratulations, everyone! What an exciting day for all of you! Oh, it's really her! Oh, pizza! First day on the job, hi, hi! Don't be nervous! I won't bite! Hi, i'm Smiler! Ho ho ho ho ho... DON'T TOUCH ME! Hi! I mean.. Hey.. As you know, i'm Smiler, i'm the system supervisor here, because I was the original emoji. Here's how it works. It's nothing fancy! Wait a minute... It's really fancy! You each have your own cube on the emoji bar! If Alex chooses you, should you be so lucky, your cube will light up! It's showtime! The scanner will scan you, and that scan will get sent right up to Alex's text box. And let me tell you guys, there is nothing like getting scanned for the first time. A har, you're gonna love it. Now over here is the favorites section, where you'll find all the most popular emojis. And of course, you'll find my cube here. Whoo. You are smooth. Just doing my duty. Ha ha ha! What did I say? Come on, tell me you aren't just a little bit tempted? Steven, for the last time, I don't want to buy a timeshare. Come on, man, it's Hi-5! You know me! I'm a favorite! Alex hasn't picked you in weeks. When he stops picking you, you're no longer a favorite. There's gotta be some sort of mistake, I mean, look at me, i'm an attractive, hand-giving Hi-5! Oh! Fistbump! Come on in! Hey, ladies! FISTBUMP? He's a knucklehead! Literally! Look at him, I can look like that! Ugh, ow, cramp.. Big mistake.. Oh... Help me.. Help up a hand.. Oh... Here you go... Thanks mate... Hey, little man, how about you create a distraction, and i'll just slip under the rope! Uh, oh, is someone lost? Smiler, hiya, just leaving. Yeah, you know, just killing time before I go back to my cube in the far corner where Alex can't even See Me ANYMORE! You may not be a favorite anymore, but you will always have a place, in a cube! Yeah, in the nosebleeds... Uh, i'm standing right here? Words hurt. The most important thing I can tell you is to just be yourself... Basically, happy itself... I am always smiling... Places, please! Emojis to your cubes! Attention, we've got incoming! Gotta be meh, gotta be meh. Oh my gosh, my own cube! I can't believe it... Oh, I could put a plant over here, and over here could go an inspirational calendar, okay, gotta be meh... Look at our son get on there, i'm beaming... With pride! You don't think he'll actually get picked, do you? Hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics was an ancient language of picture forms. Does that remind anyone of anything. Hello. A language of pictures... Anyone? Early hieroglyphics back in ancient... I gotta reply to Addie's text! What should I write? Nothing! Nothing? Words aren't cool. Ok, be cool, be cool... Alright, Alex is not sure how he wants to play this... Oh! I would really love it to be me! Beam me up! Beam me up! I need thumbs up on standby! Oh yeah! Thumbs up is going in! Wait! Alex is changing his mind! He's moving! Ok, looks like it's gonna be meh... I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug. We are go for meh! Initiating scan! Okay, you can do this. Ah! I can't do this! I can't do it! Stop the scan! I can't, it's too late! Oh! What's he doing? He's making the wrong face! Good for him, little... Wait, what? Ugh. Abort, abort! Oh, shi... Shut it down, shut it down! Ah! What is that emoji? All the emojis present, evacuate the cube! Evacuate the cube! I gotta get out of here! I'm trying! Oh, jeez. Sorry, everybody. That is not what I meant to do! I kinda.. I kinda panicked.. Are you even a meh at all? Uh, who, me? Like you are, is a malfunction! A malfunction? No, I can be meh, just give me one more chance? You know what would be really fun? A board meeting, where we can find out what to do with you! I just wanted to be useful, you know, fit in! Now everybody's calling me a malfunction. I am a malfunction. Even if you are a malfunction, Gene, your mom and dad still love ya. I knew you weren't ready. Let's get you out of here and take you home. One day, all of this will blow over, and everyone will almost forget about what you did. Until then, you should probably stay locked up in the apartment. Wait, you're gonna hide me away? You're embarrassed of me. It's for your own safety. We're trying to protect you, son. Gene, where are you going? I'm not going to run away from this. I'm an emoji, and, even though i'm not exactly sure which one... I've gotta have some sort of purpose here, I know it. Gene, no! Sweetie, please! So, how'd it go, Gavel? Hey, Lightbulb, tell me what's going on in there. What... Poop... What is it? Tell me turd, tell me truth. What happened? I know it was an accident. We all have accidents you're so soft, Poop. Not too soft, I hope. I came up here to defend myself, but, uh, you seem pretty happy. So, good news? I'm always happy. Oh, right, yeah, truth. But the only thing that could ever make me unhappy, is if one of our emojis has made a mistake. Which would cause Alex to lose faith in the phone... And then, our whole gets wiped out! Smiler, I devil pinky swear promise to you that I will never, ever make a mistake in the cube again. Oh, we know you won't, Gene. We know you won't! Ha ha, you know, the first time you said it it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it, and, and then, now it's weird. We're setting you up! With our best anti virus bots! So they'll, like, uh, they'll just, they're gonna fix me? Actually, delete you. But yes! Wait, what? If you get deleted, you don't have to worry about department heads, or the future, or lying about being a malfunction! Because you're deleted, right? Right! Good job! Bots! No! Stop, he's escaped! Party time! Oh, wait a minute... The air is better here! Beer, tea... I'm coffee! Sorry... Ish... Soishy. My old cube! Ugh, pinkeye. Mike! My name's not Mike... Ah! There's AV bots coming! What, me? Just because i'm in",10,0,KAIROEN,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.21701020596627996,2018-01-28 06:06:57,False,False

2018-02-12T04:23:37,"As a nine year old, I can honestly say that this movie is TERRIBLE. I've seen a lot of people in the comments saying things like ""THIS MOVIE WAS TARGETED FOR 5-11 YEAR OLDS SO STOP HATING ON IT"" but, in reality there are so many things wrong with it and pretty obviously was made for money. I'm not stupid, ok? This movie has SO MANY advertisements ""hidden"" within it, it seems like they just don't care anymore! Also, they add absolutely NO LOGIC to this story at all! It's fine to have an amount of fantasy in your story, but at least don't make tons of plotholes just because it's easier.. The characters are just awful, they don't seem to have any personality. Take Alex for example, he's just extremely locked up inside his smartphone, and all he wants to do is impress a girl he likes. However, not by using words, but THROUGH EMOJIS. The emojis ""just wanna fit in""... sound familiar? It's the most chliché storyline ever. Also, they try to sneak in adult jokes. I have absolutely no idea why, but they just do it. One example is, when a conversation came up about love, our favorite Hi-5 emoji said ""When a peace sign only gave me only one finger,  I knew she was in love with me"". What the heck?! Why are they referencing the middle finger?! There are just SO many terrible poop puns, and it seems like they just expected people to let them slide. All in all, this movie is very flawed and I can see why people don't like it. I'm disappointed in what you expect kids to consider quality content. Sony Pictures Animation, I know you can do better than this. Sure, say all you want about ""YOU couldn't make a movie this good"" or something like that, because you're right, I couldn't. I just know Sony Pictures is capable of making things much better than this, because I do enjoy most of their movies. Sorry if I offended you, and I won't criticize you for enjoying this movie. This is just my vision of this film, so if you have a constructive opinion about it, please tell me and I will take it into deep consideration.

2018-07-10T00:40:14,"This movie is so diverse. The message really is dependet on the reciever. (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD)  You could be a toddler and focus on the music and the colors.  You could be a child and just focus on the poop and fart jokes with the dancy feelings on most of the music parts  You could be a teen and focus on the story and follow along.  You could also be an adult and get the small hints of sex jokes and so on. But if you think about every scene  twice, everything changes Disney told us a wonderfull message, if you haven't figured it out yet, i'm here to enlighten you.  At the beginning of the movie, it was set during high school, the Gen-Z's that were mostly relying on techs and gadgets. Thus setting up the enviroment.  Then we got introduced to Gene. A different emoji in a world were differencials are unacceptable, his parents like-wise. This could be applied into real life. He then tries to fit in, he want to fit in and so began the journey to find Jailbreak and make him ""normal""  On the way we got to know that Gene has a great personality, friends first was one of the more shallow messages but the more important message came later.  The journey they went on. Hi-five, Gene and Jailbreak's trip was astounding, thus Gene caught feelings for jailbreak.  Jailbreak rejected him at the end and the happy ending was on the horizon.  The message was as true as ever. You grow up getting told to be same as everyone else, no exceptions, group pressure is a fact and normality is a law. You try to change yourself for someone you love, someone you befriend with and the groups you're hanging out with. And along the way, you'll have difficulties, deppresion and feeling outside is a fact among us teens (i know it's foward but it's true) And so you get a lifesaver. The one in a million that helps you trought everything, in this case it was Jailbreak and Hi-Five. This livesaver is almost 100% the opposite sex. You go trought hell together and fall in love, getting rejected is common and eventually you get to see the harsh reality and the consenquence of being different. You give that up and fall amongst the normal's. (When he became a meh in the end) But things go bright in the end, everyone embraced his differences and things went north. The thing is, no matter how different you are. Don't give it up to fit in Cause in the end, you might just be the one that is ""Normal""  Feel free to comment if i missed any important messages in the movie, hope you'll see this movie as an enlightment and not just an another disney-filler movies.",1,4,Prophet,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.23529914529914528,2018-07-10 00:40:14,False,False

Compare this with e.g. InsideOut which is built on the same concept. To even name InsideOut in the same sentence as Emoji Movie shall be classified as a crime or sin.

2019-05-03T04:21:44,"I'm seeing a lot of people comment ""You can't complain too much about these films, they're for kids"", I have to counter argue this defence with these points:   1) The term ""It's a kids' movie"" can defend why a film isn't too violent or why it has a colourful art style, but it shouldn't be used to explain why a film is bad, children's films aren't immune from criticism and ""It's a Kids' movie"" isn't a license for a film to be lazy or uncreative.   2) The Default acceptable standard for children's movies shouldn't be ""Whatever, it'll do, it's for kids"", especially when there's so many children's movies out there that are both emotionally challenging and imaginative, from ""Toy Story"" to ""The Secret of NIMH"", ""Matilda"" to ""The Neverending Story"", there's no excuses for children's films to get away with being insultingly low standard or unambitious.    3) Children aren't the only audience who watch these films, don't forget that parents have to see them too, why should it be a chore or punishment for them? Give them an experience that they can appreciate with their kids, a bonding opportunity that they can sincerely share.   Great children's movies respect their young audience, they don't underestimate what kids can take in as an audience, they believe that kids are smarter than we think and try to teach them to understand storytelling values, they are so well written & produced that they can be treasured for a lifetime. Let's not shrug our shoulders or turn the other cheek when a film for kids is bad, we need to call them out on their low standards or easy pandering, because the next generation deserve movies that treat them with respect and don't just see them as a money making opportunity, thank you.",8,0,Unicorn Bunny,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.03134920634920637,2019-05-03 04:21:44,False,False
2019-05-03T04:33:35,"For those of you who defend this movie by saying that it’s a kids movie, here are the list of reasons as to why this movie is bad for kids:   Gene and Jailbreak's stories essentially cancel each other out, message-wise. One wants to conform and learns to value freedom, while another wants freedom and ends up conforming. This is especially ironic considering that the main focus was about Gene learning to reject the oppressive caste system and express himself, instead of just performing his one function.  Wisecrack Edition made the case that the lesson of ""you should reject societal expectations and express who you truly wish to be"" couldn't escape unbroken. Sure, Smiler was defeated and the Emojis learn that it's perfectly fine to express more than one emotion. However, there is still the fact that they are stuck with one ''function'', to serve Alex. Emojis were invented for this very specific purpose, so Textopolis is a terrible metaphor. The movie constantly validates the idea that they should only peruse society's intended purpose for them. In Real Life, the pressure to conform can easily prevent people from being themselves.  If emojis wanted to become more than merely vessels of conveying ideas or express whatever they feel, then Alex could simply delete them as they would have outlived their usefulness. After all, Gene didn't stop the phone from being erased. It was Alex who stopped it because his crush was so Easily Impressed, and the movie fails to call him out for attempting to delete the phone data.  Aspects of the caste system still remain intact as the unpopular emojis remain in the Loser Lounge.  Jailbreak learns to stop valuing her freedom and reverts back to being a Princess.  Gene quickly discards the idea of leaving the phone forever.  Hi-5 never dumps his narcissistic ways to become a more well rounded emoji.  For a movie where women have ""limitless potential"" there don't seem to be any interestingly written female characters. The only female emojis we see with major speaking roles are Smiler, a generic order obsessed villain who runs society like a dictator, a generic princess, Jailbreak, a Jerkass who accomplishes nothing except breaking Gene's heart, and the generic love interest. There is also Gene's mother Mary, who's little more than a particularly emotionless Extreme Doormat and Akiko Glitter, who's a genuine Nice Girl but who is so expendable that our hero Gene leaves her to die in the trash can. Note that the most significant female character other than the villain, Jailbreak fits three out of those six characteristics. And it gets even worse outside of the phone, where Addie is merely a Satellite Love Interest with less character than the emojis.  If Jailbreak is meant to be a strong independent-minded female role model, then why does she learn to fit in with the same societal expectations that she found sexist? It seems to suggest that you can only save the day by following tradition, since revealing herself as a princess is treated as an empowering moment. And why does the movie treat her as being incredibly selfish for rejecting Gene's fairy-tale views of romance?  The fact that it's the male character who learns to value freedom while the female character who learns to conform and become a potential love interest also sends uncomfortable implications about a woman's place in the world...  Also, Jailbreak's heavy-handed rants about women being denied positions of power and the ability to voice their own ideas seems at least a little misplaced when you realize that Smiler, the leader of the Emojis, is female! It actually makes Jailbreak's inability to achieve a high position in life seem like a product of her own Jerk Assery, incompetence, and unwillingness to conform to standards, rather than the product of a ""broken system"", and makes it seem like she's just whining and making excuses. This has the very unfortunate effect of implying the same about people in real life who complain about the Glass Ceiling...  Even throwing in a lesson about Real Women Don't Wear Dresses undermines the Be Yourself Aesop because it involves defining your life in opposition to gender roles, rather than accepting a unique identity of your own that includes a variety of traits.  Jailbreak's cred as a sophisticated hacker falls significantly short of what the movie wants us to believe what she can do. Despite her claims to be strong and independent, she almost falls to her death (in Just Dance, of all places) and her two displays of ""hacking"" in the movie (guessing the password to a firewall and deprogramming the bot that's trying to kill Gene) are both upstaged by Hi-5, of all people. Conversely, her only noteworthy accomplishment happens when she embraces her princess side and whistles for the Twitter logo, accidentally suggesting she was better off as a stereotype.  If the movie was supposed to mock and critique excessive use of technology, then this is sure as hell broken when the simple act of sending a text ultimately saves the day. Also, because we don't get to see the real problems that it causes, none of the human characters learn the drawbacks of their obsession with smartphones. For their lack of trying, the movie just makes this behaviour seem normal.  Hi-5 has to learn to stop being a narcissistic jerk and learn the value of having true friends. Yet he still yearns for popularity through the entire movie. Shortly after he comes back and says he learned his lesson, he shouts about how ""they love us"" without any humility whatsoever. He presumably reverts back to being a jerk. To make matters worse, he got along with Gene just fine and they were able to work together to accomplish their own goals, suggesting that narcissism doesn't really harm your relationships and life goals.  The message about being a supportive father is undermined since Mel changed his mind and believed that his son was ready for the prime time, yet his doubts were correct since Gene got Stage Fright on his very first day. The movie calls him out for not being supportive, yet a good parent would understand their child's strengths and weaknesses so that they can help them succeed.  The theme of Emoji prejudice against Gene is pushed hard to represent the struggles of the LGBT community, according to Word of God... but Gene actually experiences very little Fantastic Racism when he's just walking through the streets of Textopolis making various faces - the other emojis on the street seem to either like him or not care about his transgressions. Society actually allowed him to have a chance to use his talents, and he failed miserably. The only time he does get treated with major hostility is when he screws up majorly on the job in a way that puts the entire phone in danger which, honestly, is fair.  People like The Mysterious Mr. Enter have made the case that even the blatant Product Placement falls flat. Emojis are so great at communicating ideas that a normal emoji would be insufficient to communicate the basic idea of love. The main message of Be Yourself makes little sense when it comes to technology, because customers want smartphones that follow their commands, not for the apps to be whatever they want to be. The only reason that Textopolis was spared from destruction was because Gene glitched out when he was placed on the pedestal at the end, something that the creators of these apps want to avoid at all costs.",5,4,Unicorn Bunny,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.09204229797979795,2019-05-03 04:33:35,False,False

2019-06-21T03:50:23,"I'm seeing a lot of people comment ""You can't complain too much about these films, they're for kids"", I have to counter argue this defence with these points:   1) The term ""It's a kids' movie"" can defend why a film isn't too violent or why it has a colourful art style, but it shouldn't be used to explain why a film is bad, children's films aren't immune from criticism and ""It's a Kids' movie"" isn't a license for a film to be lazy or uncreative.   2) The Default acceptable standard for children's movies shouldn't be ""Whatever, it'll do, it's for kids"", especially when there's so many children's movies out there that are both emotionally challenging and imaginative, from ""Toy Story"" to ""The Secret of NIMH"", ""Matilda"" to ""The Neverending Story"", there's no excuses for children's films to get away with being insultingly low standard or unambitious.    3) Children aren't the only audience who watch these films, don't forget that parents have to see them too, why should it be a chore or punishment for them? Give them an experience that they can appreciate with their kids, a bonding opportunity that they can sincerely share.   Great children's movies respect their young audience, they don't underestimate what kids can take in as an audience, they believe that kids are smarter than we think and try to teach them to understand storytelling values, they are so well written & produced that they can be treasured for a lifetime. Let's not shrug our shoulders or turn the other cheek when a film for kids is bad, we need to call them out on their low standards or easy pandering, because the next generation deserve movies that treat them with respect and don't just see them as a money making opportunity.",4,6,Unicorn Bunny,r8pJt4dK_s4,0.03134920634920637,2019-06-21 03:50:23,False,False

What's up with all these stereotypes? Like people that don't even talk to each other because they're playing on they're phone, I know cartoons are about exaggerating things, but this was so unnecessary and exaggerated it  feels offensive, rather then funny.  For the ones wondering, I didn't watch the movie, just some clips that show what I'm talking about. If you're gonna make a movie than write a script or a plot, so you know where it ends. This feels like it started somewhere and then the story was made up as it went on. It's confusing and it doesn't make sense, that's why this movie is receiving so much hate.

The owner of the cell phone Alex has been wanting a new, better cell phone for a long time anyway because he feels that it is cooler and could impress his Chrush. Because half of the apps are missing, Alex's parents finally decide to buy him a new cell phone and destroy the old one. The emojis outside the cell phone must now find Alex cell phone as quickly as possible and return to their place.  Still pretty bad but better than this.",10,2,Thomas Klein,r8pJt4dK_s4,-0.003282828282828279,2020-05-03 08:42:39,False,False

2020-05-16T00:39:43,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Emoji Movie. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gene's meh outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Gene's existencial catchphrase ""meh,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tony Leondis' genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have an Emoji Movie tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

2020-06-01T20:52:04,"The emoji movie is a beautifully executed, well layered experience that has been the victim of a barrage of such biased reviews such as “The worst movie of 2017” , “ a very formulaic story” and “9% on Rotten Tomatoes.” So, in defense of this movie, i will give you, the reader, why The Emoji Movie is in fact the best movie of in 2017. Remember, though, that this essay has some of my opinions, and takes on certain parts of the film.   The Story. The story is a beautifully written, homage to many fairy tales. If you have not watched this movie yet, here's the rundown of the story. Gene is a meh emoji in a world of other emoji’s on a teenager’s smartphone. Gene, not wanting to be like the other emoji’s, goes out to find himself. Along the way, he stumbles across his best friend, HI-5, one of the many other unused emoji’s and allows him to join Gene in his quest. For this journey, he also enlists a help of a rather infamous hacker known as the alias “Jailbreak” to join them in his adventures. During this adventure, going app to app, seeing the many wonders it has to offer, Gene and crew find something that could wipe out their world as a whole, so Gene and Crew set out to stop this threat. Now that the explanation of the story is finished, I would like to, once again state, that it is on of THE BEST movies of the year(Not statistically, that is). First off, the story is so unique in it’s setting and characters. The Setting. The setting of this movie is so rich in detail where do i even start. The first area,Textopolis, is an amazingly detailed place. The emoji’s all living in harmony is a sight to see. The vibrant color’s are eyecandy to anyone with a good taste in movies. You can see all the emoji’s specifically animated to perfection. You have to give Sony animations praise for this work, that was undeniably made with love. Secondly, the apps that the emoji’s go to in the movie are all specifically themed with their IRL(in real life) counterpart, and i have to say is cleverly themed. The Just Dance app, actually having Gene and crew dance, is an undeniably funny part of the movie that i recommend you to watch. Now that i have surely convinced you about the beauty of the movie’s setting, i will now return to The Character’s   The protagonist, his name being Gene, a nod to the word generic, is depicted as a boring, bland, person, which fits the theme, of his character perfectly. The next Character, HI-5, is an undeniably funny character that is there to unwind the stress of the events, like for comedy relief, which is also coincidentally played by James Corden, one of the funniest people in the universe( irony ). And his character is also appropriately themed after his name, actually being a hand, which ties in nicely. The third main character, Jailbreak, is a hacker emoji, being depicted as a dark figure shrouded in her hoodie, which is nonetheless nice about the character, but is amazingly revealed at the end of the movie that she is a princess emoji, not a hacker emoji that simply got bored of being a princess, which teaches kids to be unique, be different from everyone else, break the rules, be themselves, and that is a beautiful lesson to be executed in such a well manner. The Emoji movie is an in depth movie with so many different layers, with the setting and the characters and the story that i commend it in any and every way. I give it an 11/10, Something i give to only the best of the best. Now, with my 1000000+ iq, i will tackle bigger movies.
