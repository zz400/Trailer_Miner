Of course there's no mountain high enough in life that God wouldn't be able to help us reach the top.But for most of us, it takes a lot longer, it takes a lot more serious pruning, correction, molding, setbacks, to achieve what God is doing in our life and our heart, and for some it comes easier than others. I personally use to think I learned spiritual growth on the mountain, but, I was seriously wrong, it's the valleys and deserts where we get a dose of reality and gain more spiritual knowledge and grow into a new level of spiritual understanding, where we  have our eyes opened our hearts broken and humbled, it's a lifetime process called sanctification. Why did Jesus say, that in the last days, the love of many will grow cold ?, I wonder. In these undeniable godless immoral last days that we are living in today, let us not grow weary and faint. I only say this because of the tremendous struggles in my own life and heart. brother's and sister's in Christ, time is short, things will get worse in our society, and we must pray for each other. Especially for our brother's and sister's in other countries who are facing real persecution, even to death. We have it easy here in America, for now. Yes there is some resistance towards Christianity, but not like in some hostile muslim countries where they kill Christians. Our loyalty and faith will be tested here in America too, why should we be spared persecution and not our brother's and sister's in Foreign countries. Believers who actually by into the selfish teaching of the pre tribulation rapture are in for a very shocking rude awakening, I use to believe in the pre tribulation rapture myself at one time, But, no more. Let's just say for argument sake, I had my scriptural and spiritual understanding changed with some sound biblical truth. How much of the tribulation we will experience, I don't know, but we will experience it. Jesus said, whoever endures to the end, will be saved. I strongly suggest, and advice and encourage us to be ready and be prepared, earnestly and wholeheartedly seek the Lord, pray and meditate on the word of God, and keep your oil lamp FULL. spread the word, time is short.",0,0,Bobby Rodriguez,BGyieGVn4P4,0.05461174242424243,2019-05-05 14:40:14,True,True

One of the best places to teach and apply the gospel is in  families. God has established families to bring happiness to  His children, to allow us to learn correct principles in a loving  atmosphere, and to prepare us to return to Him after we die.  Although family relationships can be challenging at times, our  Heavenly Father blesses us as we strive to follow the teachings  of Jesus Christ. These teachings help us strengthen our families.   HEAVENLY FATHER REVEALS HIS GOSPEL  As part of His plan, God chooses prophets, such as Adam,  Noah, Abraham, and Moses.

We need to repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The church is asleep and they don't even know it. Wake up people. Obey the words of God. Stop idolizing celebrities and musical artists who never tell you to repent of your sins but they still make lots of money off of you. We love to hear and see things that make us feel emotional but rarely do you see people who want to hear the truth of Gods word especially the parts that hurt. We need to repent. God gives us time but He only gives us so much time. Just because you go to church doesn't mean you're going to heaven. Revelation 2:21  21And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. 22Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 23And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.",0,0,s h,BGyieGVn4P4,0.21704545454545457,2019-05-07 17:02:44,True,True

For years, John has created and felt comfortable in his identity as a worship leader in a megachurch and now that identity has been stripped away.

Eventually, the brain tells the feelings, ""Something isn't right here."" And if the brain doesn't have the tools to explain the contradictions, then the person will move on to a new source of feelings / fame / intellectual stimulation. Mid-Acts dispensationalist's like Randy White Ministries have been rightly dividing for years, saying ""Acts is such a key transitional book, that without it, one could never go from Luke to Romans without tossing the whole thing in the trash..""  Something happened before AD70 to slowly transition the Bible message from a Petristic Gospel of Christ (a rejected Kingdom offer made to the Jews), to a simplistic Pauline Gospel by Faith alone to everyone of all nations.. without distinction. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to re-read Acts to Romans 11, and determine if God really has put the nation of Israel ""on the shelf"" until the ""times of the Gentiles be fulfilled"" (blatant clue: yes there was a dispensation change).",0,0,Cliff Matthews,BGyieGVn4P4,0.03709415584415583,2019-08-14 23:59:32,True,True

2019-08-28T00:06:07,"Disclaimer: I’m a Christian, I absolutely love Jesus, but I want to express something that I would like to see revolutionized.   I use to cringe when I’d watch Christian contemporary movies because of how I felt like they were TRYING to make it marketable like Hollywood, but still squeeze in and/or overemphasize the message of Jesus. And the actors (though they tried their best) also were not very good—they acted like amateurs. I was really ashamed because the Christian film community had been reduced to sweet Pureflix movies and nothing resonating enough to take Hollywood by storm, yet, still maintaining an extremely strong Gospel message. I mean, how am I supposed to convince my nonbeliever friends that following Jesus is awesome and recommend some cool 😎 Christian films that aren’t 🤢?   This isn’t for all Christian movies of course 😂😂😂 (e.g. Priceless) if you take your time, sift, read through Rotten Tomato or whatever you’re sure to find a really wholesome, epic, and inspiring CM! 😁  I wrote this comment because these brothers are different! From the manner in which they direct their films, you know God is guiding the whole process. The actors are a lot better than what I see in a lot of Christian movies (*cough* A Man Called John *cough* WWJD *cough* nah, but a man called John was low-key inspiring)   This....? Now THAT’S what’s up! And the plot seems is really interesting, which I like because then we start seeing secular audiences glancing this way and getting curious about this whole “Jesus deal”. We have people in comment sections saying “I’m not religious but I still liked this movie” but later on their minds are are stimulated by the message of Jesus and are led to Him!   Didn’t intend to trigger anyone at all or come off as arrogant or... something else I can’t think of that would probably trigger someone, I don’t know 😂😂. Just being honest and maybe expressing something that other people have noticed as well.  Edit: I actually just came home from  cross country practice; we ran a 5k today.

2019-08-29T21:19:46,"Ok... as a person from Columbus, Georgia (the place this movie was filmed), I'm going to talk about how wack this movie's setting is. First of all the school is called Brookshire High School which is a direct copy of Brookstone High School, an actual school in Columbus, Georgia. They even have the same logo and mascot, the cougars.  Brookstone is the most expensive private school in the city, and they are also the only ones that have mandatory drug testing of all students from grades 8-12. This is because they have had issues with their students and drugs for a very long time. The most ironic part of all this is that Brookshire is portrayed as a struggling school with pay cuts and the obvious shortage of faculty members, but in actuality, Brookstone has a reputation of having some of the richest students, an enormous campus, and of course rich parents. The worst part of all this is that Brookstone school's rival is a CATHOLIC school called St. Anne-Pacelli Catholic School. Pacelli has a tiny campus, a lack of proper funding and faculty, and very poor classroom conditions. Only in recent years have they recently been given money for proper AP classes and better conditions. It's so weird to a Columbus, GA resident (and alum of Pacelli high school), to see the narrative be so twisted. Wouldn't it make sense for a financially struggling catholic school be the setting for a movie like this?",0,0,Nevermore,BGyieGVn4P4,0.009696969696969688,2019-08-29 21:19:46,False,True

This is the first film from the Kendrick Brothers that I didn't care for:  1. Some ""people"" are known for meddling and trying to play savior. This was a minor child & they were not her legal guardian. What if the meeting between Hannah and her father had gone terribly wrong? They had no right to overstep the rights of the grandmother.  2. An African-American man being portrayed as someone who abandoned his child? Yeah, that's a new one. (sarcasm intended.)  3. An African-American hooked on Meth?
