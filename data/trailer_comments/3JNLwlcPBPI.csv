2015-11-10T14:58:36,"Oh my god! The long awaited teaser trailer. Alright, my thoughts.  First of all the animation is absolutely beautiful. it's stunning. The bit in the trailer I find amazing is where Marlin says ""Something important? what?"" Would you just look at the detail, the quality and the fluency of it. It's outstanding! Just look at the lighting of the water even! The most simple of things it's just absolutely mesmerising!   Second of all the story. Interesting concept. As we all know, being around Nemo and Merlin somehow managed to help her remember things...And according to sources this movie is two years after the events for the first. But I'm glad you didn't show very much. It's best to keep the good bits hidden. It makes it more exciting and more memorable that way in a sense.   Lastly, the music. Reusing Finding Nemo's main two themes I see? I hope you did that to hide the music you're composing for this movie, pixar! It may bring down the hype just a tad but it's not enough to destroy it.   As for the new Nemo, nice choice. He sounds a little older (which makes sense cause it's two years after the first one). He sounds perfect for the job uvu  All in all, bRING IT ON!

Dory was named after her grandma. Her family was breed  in captivity.  Dory's mom is named May.  Dory has two other sisters Luna and Bella.  When Dory was little her parent's friended a fish named ""Chase"" who helped Dory and her sisters leave captivity for a better life in the ocean.   Dory is the oldest of the two sisters.  While escaping Dory got split form Chase and her two sisters.  She had a traumatic experience and fainted.  When she woke up she was greeted by a Old looking fish who helped Dory for the next 3 years until the fish went missing.

Dory was able to recall where she last saw Chase she went looking for him and found him he had been waiting for her all those years just incase she came back.  Chase contacted a bird friend of his and together they where able to locate her Mom and Dad.  They managed to make a escape plan and they all went back to the great barrier reef.  Along the way she meet her two sister who both have a family of their own.  The End   EDIT:  The Fishes that where introduced in the cast where meet along the way.

2015-11-13T02:03:12,"I might have figured out something...  Think back on the early days of Pixar there were the 6 orignal films....  Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2,  Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles.  Now why am I repeating what we already know? Read on...  You see Toy Story was the most critically acclaimed film in the history of Disney and Pixar as it was the first completely computer animated film in the history of Disney. Abandoning the old format of drawing pictures, but still maintaining the magic of Walt Disney. So it's no suprise Toy Story would have sequels, right?  3 movies and a couple short films are in total in Toy Story  Now...  Bug's Life is probably one of the most underrated films of Pixar. It's very sad. Is it because of the plot? I think it was pretty original and paining homage to the way of life. Eat or be eaten. Most people just forget about this film, but why? If I'm not mistaken Bug's Life is the film that introduced the ""outtake sequences"" you know the ones showed in the credits? I think maybe because of people forgot about it, it's most likely Pixar is holding back on creating Bug's Life 2.   Monsters Inc, did get a sequel... I mean excuse me, a prequel, you know I would love the sequel even way more. I wanted to see what happens with Monsters Inc now using laughs as fuel source and the return of Boo. I know I shouldn't be begging for a real sequel to Monster's Inc as there is technically one, but when you leave the audience in a cliffhanger you need to do a sequel! Not a prequel, because that's what drives a cliffhanger even more further! I still saw the movie anyways, but I had some mixed reviews with the film. It just didn't have the same charm as the first film. It almost felt like Cars...  Now with Finding Nemo getting a sequel, that's the direction a movie should go, and I'm not saying a movie should never have prequels. No not at all, but I seriously think a prequel should be done after a sequel. You know like Star Wars? Speaking of that it's going to be great... I just know it, we can pretty much say Star Wars shares the same universe as Pixar and Disney and as well as Marvel and Jim Henson shows, because they are all owned by Disney now...  And the Incredibles, is the most unique film of the original 6. It always seemed that we couldn't get enough of super hero movies, they were pretty good, far more better than the early Marvel movies (I hope I don't cause a backslash). Now seeing that it will get a sequel in 2019, it makes people very anxious, but remember the first movie was envisioned completely by Brad Bird, it takes a long time to make a masterpiece, and I feel it will do just fine....  So what I am saying is this may be a way of Pixar telling us something. Like reliving...   Reliving the 6 original films that made them what they are today. It's posible that Bug's Life 2 is getting a sequel...  I mean Monsters Inc got one, well more as a prequel  And Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2 as well are getting sequels and 3 of those sequels are from the original 6 Pixar films. Then there's no doubt Bug's Life is getting a sequel, it may not be the truth, but that's the way I see it...",1,0,NoobhunterΣ7,3JNLwlcPBPI,0.19777056277056276,2015-11-13 02:03:12,True,True

There's going to be an amazing 10-20 opening minutes as it sinks in on theater-goers that tthe adventure is picking off right where we left it.   I also like to think this is a Pixar renaissance.

In fact, no saltwater fish are good for beginners!   Blue tangs cannot reproduce in captivity! That means that all of the blue hippo tangs you see at pet stores were taken out of the wild! Blue tangs also can get really big, they can reach up to a foot long! Which means they need really big tanks! Blue tangs can also live a super long time! Some have lived for 20 years!   After Finding Nemo came out, sales in clownfish skyrocketed! A lot of people thought Nemo was cute, so they went out and bought one. Later, it died due to the person not knowing how to care properly for a clownfish. Now, clownfish can reproduce in captivity, unlike blue tangs.  So if you know someone who wants a blue tang or clownfish because of Finding Dory, please tell them that it's a bad idea! Get a plushie instead!",132,4,Space,3JNLwlcPBPI,0.07331419665404042,2016-05-31 02:15:48,True,True

2016-06-27T18:42:41,"I liked the connection between the aquarium and the Dark Side. Yes the ocean has been trashed by the aquarium,  the Monterey Bay Ocean Conservancy group and save the sea otter foundation with the help of other groups.  There is practically no diving along this coast because any knowledgeable diver knows that only barren rocks will be found. NO giant red sea urchins, No abalone, No clams.  Those imported Northern Sea Otters have totally put this ocean out of balance. The sea urchins and abalone clean the algae off the rocks so new life can grow. The clams are the filter feeders filtering the water and I believe the sea urchins also filter the water cleaning it. The kelp forest is mostly all gone now as the kelp spawn will not be able to find a clean rock to grow on. Any spawn will die if it can only find a algae covered surface to land on and can't find a place the grow its roots that is free of algae. The oxygen level also decreases. It is a sad affair.        The Ocean Conservancy group now owns most of the Coastal waters and I believe it will be hard to get them to allow us to get rid of this invasive species (northern sea otter vs southern sea otter that once was native to this area).       I believe that the invasive and imported sea otter has to go and laws need to be reversed or put in place that will allow seeding this coastline with fertilized spawn from sea urchins, abalone and kelp. The spawn farms would support a lot of jobs for the local economy.         The introduction of this fertilized spawn to the environment will help the ocean in this area to recover to the clean environment it once was before the introduction of the northern sea otter in the late 60's.",0,0,Mark Hamerdinger,3JNLwlcPBPI,0.11284271284271286,2016-06-27 18:42:41,False,True

The problem is that although I know that there's quality to it... I don't like it? There's one thing that I'm sure that I don't like: the pacing: everything just goes too fast for the main characters to be developped! That's what I feel at least. Normally when I finish movies, even the ones that weren't really enjoyable, I have a feeling of accomplisment, but for this film...

2016-08-18T02:01:09,"Finding Dory is an animation movie made for children and the whole family as well. It tells a story about a forgetful fish named Dory that has lost herself from her parents since she was a little fish. From the begining to the end she counts on two good friends named Nemo and Marlin. Together they go through a funny and colorful journey to find Dory's parents. Most of it takes place in a public aquarium in California, where Dory believes her parents are living in. The main message is the importance of family and friends in our lives.

2017-12-28T01:45:36,"I really did not find Finding Dory that good. I was so dissapointed. I really feel there was a deep connection between Nemo in the first movie, he lost his Mother, he went to school and you got to see how worried his dad was for Nemo starting school and how awful it would be for him to lose his son if he was to go missing after Marlin losing his family.. and then in the second movie we had no connection or build up to Dory's parents, I mean.. yea I do care Dory lost her parents but if she found them or not I really didn't care.. The movie was also less colourful than the first movie, the ocean was beautiful, the jellyfish were bright, even the fish tank was more beautiful than any of the scenes in the second movie, even Marla was more stunning (lol jks) but I just feel that Finding Nemo hit the heartstrings 100% while Finding Dory didn't, Ellen's voice acting was also very different in the second movie, when Ellen spoke in the first movie she had a genuine tone to her voice about being forgetful but in the second movie she sounds as if she was bored of the same 'forgetfullness' idea and was like yea.. they get the idea i'm a forgetful fish, but dory was so much more down to earth in the first movie, the forgetfulness added character to her character and she was just a lovable character throughout the whole movie, she was fun.. and you fell in love with her, in the second movie I also found some scenes far-fetched and the scene where the kids are putting their hands in the rockpools was irritating 😂 I just wish the movie was set in the ocean and not a small aqua-zoo, when you watched them in the ocean, you could use your imagination about what was going to come next, what lurks in the ocean? but in an aqua-zoo that is clearly not huge there isn't much for the imagination to go by, I love Finding Nemo so much! but Finding Dory was a let down for me, the only scene I found funny was when the beavers lined up and I literally was wondering if the beavers actually got ran over and the kids were sitting in the cinema watching a graphic scene take place, how funny that would be! 😂",1,1,Aaron,3JNLwlcPBPI,0.14321581196581196,2017-12-28 01:45:36,False,False
