2018-07-24T10:48:07,I have never been so disappointed in a prequel in my life until I saw this one. Although it was funny it seemed to be forced funny. Although it was musically talented it seemed to be pushing ABBAs unsuccessful music.  And bringing back everyone was awesome except Donna was only a figment of Sophie's imagination because they killed her off. And that was something that was totally unnecessary because they could have put her stranded at a ski resort somewhere instead.  But they couldn't put Cher and Meryl Streep side-by-side when Cher looks so much younger than Meryl Streep due to her plastic surgery so there you go.

She used to be one of my favorite actresses, but gosh...she should definitely stop! It was good to see the members of the ""old"" cast though, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried and especially the two ladies from hell, ravishing Christine Baranski and ever-grumpy Julie Walters - they really brought the house down and eventually made the movie a mediocre evening's entertainment.

2020-04-03T01:38:02,"This trailer is so misleading. All of the stuff about her being pregnant and feeling close to her mom doesn't happen until the final act of the movie, here it's displayed as the main plot and the reason she's reminiscing about her mother's past. She also asks in the trailer ""I never did ask you guys, what happened when you met my mother?"" this was an edited line for the trailer, she never said this in the movie. What she did say was asking Rosie what happened between her and Bill (because they were broken up for some reason).  So then why were we seeing flashbacks to Donna's past? We just... kinda were. It would've made more sense if it was how it was displayed in the trailer as Sophie seeking out information about Donna, but that never happened.   ""We can't tell anyone about the baby yet"" was another edited line. The real line was ""We didn't tell anyone yet"" and it was a really short joke about how news spread so fast about her being pregnant, there was never a plot about trying to keep the baby secret.  Also what we see of Cher in the trailer, where they're framing her as a main supporting character of the movie the way they would frame Rosie or any other character with at least 20 minutes of screentime, yeah we get maybe like, a few more minutes of Cher in the movie. That's really it. She also doesn't show up until the final act. Same thing with Billy and Harry. They're framed here as main supporting characters, yet they also don't show up until the final act. And even still, with the small amount of screentime they had, they had way more than Cher did. To give you perspective of how little screentime they had, they had to re use a scene twice within the same minute in this trailer due to not having enough screentime of them together. 0:35 and 0:41",0,0,whatever dani does,nd4cLL_MP7M,0.042638888888888886,2020-04-03 01:38:02,False,False
