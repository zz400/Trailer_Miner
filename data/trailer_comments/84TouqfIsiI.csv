I loved unbreakable, Signs, the Village (although not a fan of the ""twist"") and his recent outing, The Visit. The only ones I've seen that I didn't like were Lady in the Water and The Happening. I never had any desire to see The Last Airbender,  but I'll assume it's as bad as everyone says, and technically he really didn't have much to do After Earth except direct it. Apparently the script, story, editing, and such was pretty much left to Will Smith's ""vision"" so I don't think it's fair to blame him for that one.

I personally believe that making yet another movie containing an antagonist with a mental disorder as severe (a different word has eluded me) as DID is likely to perpetuate stigma and fear. I'm assuming that there will be supernatural elements thrown in, but adding a diagnosis complicates matters.   There are plenty of mental disorders that have received unrealistic portrayals, both positive and negative, and I'm sure that Schizophrenia and PTSD immediately come to mind for many. For those of you planning to see this movie, it might be beneficial for you to read up on DID so that you can walk into the show with a bit more insight.   With all that being said, please have a lovely day/night. 😊",0,0,Kai MacPherson,84TouqfIsiI,0.09041125541125541,2016-07-28 12:50:23,True,True

2016-07-28T20:29:34,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mike Hunt, writing to tell you about my brilliant experience at Kingswood. I really enjoyed the activities at Kingswood. My favourite was the zip wire. When I got to the top of the 40 feet tower my knees were shaking, even though I knew I was totally safe because I was harnessed up and the instructors were qualified. The scariest part was when Johnny (the instructor) counted down from 3 to 1 and I walked off the edge of the tower and started zipping down at a whopping 25 miles per hour. My most scary activity was abseiling because the instructor kept telling you to lean back and you thought you were going to fall off. The food at Kingswood was absolutely delicious. On Sunday night we had a lovely roast with chicken, potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and to give it extra flavor we added nice, smooth gravy to it.  My favourite was the Spaghetti Bolognese because it is my most favourite food in the whole wide world The staff at Kingswood were funny and had a sense of humor. Johnny was really laid back and he even let the girls give him a hair makeover. Fishy Phil never gives up and really loves archery. Georgina was really girly and always played rubbish pop songs on Johnny’s portable speaker. Levon was really outgoing and due to her having dreadlocks she had never washed her hair in two years. The facilities at Kingswood were great. You can get up to a nice and warm power shower then go to your minty clean dorms to have a chat before going to activities. After a long day of activities you can go lie down on the super comfy mattresses and rest your head on the pillow and fall asleep. To get gifts or just get a drink you can go to shop and get your daily essentials for a super cheap price.      Overall my experience at Kingswood was amazing and I would definitely go again.

2016-07-28T20:47:45,"oh dear - my friend showed me this trailer the other day -  my guess is that these are ALL 23 of his personalities meeting each other for the first time. He has been sent to some hospital for experimental treatment where this new therapy helps him confront his splits so he can ""release"" them and find his ""true"" self...only something goes wrong and his personalities all want to fight to stay alive because they all think they are real. Some personalities are children, some male, some female, some teens, some helpers, some hurters. The beast is the twist - the beast could be the ""therapist"" who has split a normal man she kidnapped into 23 personalities - she may end up being his mom who also has split personalities! Or the beast could end up being the teenaged girl in the beginning - after all she is the one walking behind the other two laughing, oblivious girls, and she is the one who looks strangely at the man (is he their dad?) putting things in the trunk - right before she straps herself into the car - she seems to be the odd girl out. She probably hit him over the head with something and then put him in the trunk before hopping in as ""the girl"" and then the two in the back seat finally notice that he is not their dad. Or the girl could be an emerging new personality - a teenager - who is witnessing some of the other personalities. She will have to fight to earn her space with so many other personalities manifesting. Perhaps it's an inside look at how a person creates and absorbs multiple personalities. It looks interesting - and I found the part about changing the chemistry the most interesting.

The reason they hide alters in public is not to protect you from them, but to protect themselves from your scorn and fear.  If someone has DID (a disorder that statistically affects more women) she is constantly putting all of her energy into appearing normal and leading a balanced and healthy life. Meanwhile she has to fight against the overwhelming image of fear that surrounds her disorder, specifically, all her life.Though DID is just as common as bipolar disorder, media treats it as an incurable malady that destroys everything around it.

Also, the Concept of the movie is brilliant; 3 girls abducted by a man with MPD (or just really frick frackin clever)  and it's up to the girls to try and get out with the help of one of the man's many personalities that could possibly hurt or help them.  Really a splendid set up for a suspense/ thriller movie.   On the otherhand: it's an M. Night Shyamalan film, which honestly set's it up for a downfall in someway. Shyamalan is Infamous and Notorious for throwing in unnecessary and overly bad twists (In my opinion) and or ends up throwing in something supernatural to throw the plot along. He's also been known to give the characters really bland personalities, rendering his movies predictable. Laughable. or a combination of the two.

DID is something that exist and everyone's system are different so I'm sure someone had a few similarities with this man and no not as in abducting a few kids. My advice if you wish to see this film, come with a mature mind. Don't assume the people behind this are all jackasses because they gave the character DID and you may have had it and none of what going on has ever occurred (to your knowledge that is). Some mental disorders can lead to behaviour such as shown in SPLIT and people may actually believe EVERYONE with DID will kidnap children and go psycho. My motto is we are not crazy. The ideal human behaviour is civilised meaning that our government says which traits(brain development)are considered as normal(based on the majority). Seeing one who is not considered are feared which is a crazy way to do things. We are all different. Disorders are differences and they're not so different because no victim is special. I can stand saying I have bipolar and when I look to my right, someone is saying just the same beside me. We need to laugh at reality(the reality to the unknown minority).

Hollywood makes many things look bad which is why instead of boycotting, educate people because lets face it, no matter how much you boycott, it's still going to be released and billions of people are still going to see it. This movie doesn't define you. You define yourselves, so create a definition.  If you lose friends because of your disorder, as much as it hurts, remember that they dont deserve you. Not only would they  have you as a friend, but your alters as well. Plus, if you really lose them because they find out you have DID, they're not really your friends, now are they? You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you for the beautiful person you are 😘  I will say though, if you have littles, please treat them like any other child and protect them. Dont necessarily do your best to keep the movie from them but also dont tell them about it. If they find out about it and they get upset, console them and let them know that that is not who you are and that this movie will not change how people look at you. Try to keep them their happy selves.   Remember, dont hate, but educate. That is the best way to deal with things like this ❤   Love and light, Abigail 😘  P.S. if anyone would like to vent, feel free to message me.

The problem is that the movie portrays someone with a disease of the brain (dissociative identity disorder-DID) who is therefore violent and frightening because of his disease.  The indirect message: people who have DID are dangerous, violent, threatening, etc.  That is a cruel, false message that can negatively impact perceptions of people with DID.  It's almost cliche to say mental illness is stigmatized.  I thought Hollywood would have gotten the message by now.    Obviously, a responsible approach would be a movie that depicts a character with DID and its impact of his/her life, etc. It would be true-to-life and shed light.  A truly interesting movie, similar to ""A Beautiful Mind"" starring Russel Crowe. That movie gave audiences the opportunity to see what it was like to live with his mental illness.  With ""Split"" we get the horror movie treatment.  Some may think I am ""too sensitive.""  I don't like when an innocent group of people are stigmatized as dangerous.

2017-01-31T19:05:52,"It really angers me that people are saying that this movie puts mentally ill people in a bad light. First of all, every person is different even WITH a psychological illness. It is always wrong to assume that every one person who suffers is the same as the next. There is no way that mentioning one mentally ill individually can offend every person who suffers, everyone is different and cannot be compared for better or worse. Second of all this is a FICTIONAL horror movie. Although it is based on mental illness, it is not an educational documentary. The character suffers with a real disorder, but he is fictional and it is over exaggerated to tell an interesting story with a gripping twist. It is not made to educate us about the reality of illnesses, just to entertain us. If you want to learn about the reality of mental illnesses I suggest research, reading, and possibly taking courses to learn about it. Like I said this movie is just aiming to entertain us, not say; ""This is how mentally ill people behave"" that would be wrong and offensive.  There are many people in my life who I love who suffer with a mental illness. Two of them suffer with MPD/DID and I know that they would find this movie interesting, and gripping as a horror MOVIE. They know for sure that their illness is nothing like that, and that this movie is not trying to make people understand how the illness actually is.   If this movie really IS trying to say something about mental illnesses, I think it is trying to see that people gain empathy. As I was watching this I felt fear for the girls, but I wanted the main character who suffers to get help. It made sense to me why he suffered, due to the awful upbringing he didn't deserve. Although dangerous, he deserved help, care and to live a peaceful life, which he sadly couldn't have.   Watch the movie, enjoy that it is a fantasy. Do not see this as an educational video on mental illnesses, because it isn't AT ALL a representation of how they actually are.",0,0,Just Harriet,84TouqfIsiI,-0.04758433390508863,2017-01-31 19:05:52,False,True

The predicable parts were the two girls that died who were pretty obviously expendable from the beginning. The dr was also an interesting actress, but failed to say the 3 magic words she wrote down to save her own life, and instead left it for the unbeknownst girls later in the scene who would somehow understand that reading the full name out loud would bring the alter up without knowing. I appreciated the suggestion of violence rather than seeing the actual violence not bc it maintained sympathy for the character but bc it spared us the goreporn in so many movies. But it did spare us the horror. I wish the movie had relied more on the supernatural but not much more, and the plot sort of fell apart at the demented scene where he deems her ""pure"" bc he sees her scars. Also the element of the story of her maintaining quiet for the incestuous relationship with her uncle is not completely plausible, nor particularly satisfactory as she goes home to more twisted horror.

My brother has D.I.D., and I find this movie a non-accurate representation of these people in the media. It is inappropiate to showcase a mental condition, as harmless as D.I.D, in such a violent and terrifying way. D.I.D is a mental condition, that if it is not well understood, you are going to get carried away by all these misrepresentations in the media. D.I.D. is NOT dangerous, people with this disorder suffer from misunderstandings around them thanks to society. People that suffer from this condition are usually victims of a traumatic event as children, and the alters are generated by the brain as a mechanism of protection to the child. Alters are very unlikely to hurt anyone, they are, like us, other human beings with hopes of normal lives. Ps: This comment is in no way intended to spread hatred to the actors, nor the studio. It is just my personal opinion in regards to the portrayal of the character with D.I.D. I hope this was at the very least informative, and helped clear some things up.
