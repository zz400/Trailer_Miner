All the same, the other leads, my crush, deadly gorgeous and talented Olivia Munn, and of course the emo, yet  badass Thomas Jane are in it as leads as well. Further, the special effects and costume designs look just as good as avp and better than predators (3rd film.) Surprisingly, several plots are underway in it as well unlike most other predator films. A crashed yautja ship with commandos going after it as a flashback, a scientist and the government knowledgeable of the yautja and even on to their motives going to earth, and one even being autopsied, finally exploring the predators biology; what looks to be an interesting felon story in Thomas Jane, and of course, these tall, dark super predators whose origin is unknown. I've also had my eye on Shane Black a while and his direction and storytelling gets better with each of his films for me.

If they are going for a ""mutated predator that's the ultimate threat"" it was done in AvP Requiem. If they are going for a ""two classes of predators that are rivals"" it was done in Predators (2010). And if they're going for all of them in one film...that doesn't make it good.   I feel like they missed a great opportunity here to expand the mythos of the universe. Instead of the ""monster"" being a predator on steroids, I feel a better angle would be a whole new alien species; for example, they say they have conquered the galaxy so what if the monster ends up being a member of one of the first species they thought they exterminated a millennia ago but have actually been recovering and growing in some back corner solar system.   OR  I think it would be bad ass if they used the original design of the predator from the very first film (the one that's all red with the long neck).

Watch the film on release. Come back to my post and remind me I was right.  They skipped filler banter. Woo. But now you know they find his ship, he kills some people, they steal his gear cuz assassin's and shit, he goes to get it back, they fight him off while he murder hobos a ton of red shirt fucking cunts and then the Predator teams up with the humans because they made a enhanced predator from 1 they somehow caught at the start of the film.

So the end of the movie rolls around and the chick in this thing after killing every alien on Antarctica, and saving the life of the Predator mind you, is standing in front of their ship right. She has no jacket on and it’s probably -30. So his buddies come walking out of their UFO, hand her this spear, give her the ole thumbs up and get back in their ride leaving her there. Now this chick got there on this boat with some other people who are all dead. She is the only one alive on the continent. How is she going to get home? They couldn’t drop her off? It would have been 12 seconds out of their way in that space ship they had. Are they serious? I mean they could have at the very least offered her a ride, and then made up an excuse like there was no room or something.   “Hey, you need a ride….Oh wait, sorry, we only have room for 8.

All I’ve heard and seen on YouTube and the net during the build up of this movie is negative vibes, either rumours about the plot being bad, the cast being bad, if the predator will side with the humans or not... now the second trailer is out people saying “oh thanks for showing the mutant predator now I don’t have to watch it” amongst other things. This movie doesn’t stand a chance because of so many twats online that just have to be negative about everything. The first predator movie was a one off in the sense that it was so fresh at the time! I’m 38 now and I remember watching that for the first time as a kid and being totally in awe at it! After I watched it and it scared the shit outa me lol, I woke and ran downstairs the next morning to watch it again on vhs and pausing it to see if I could see the predator when cloaked 😂, it’s was just amazing and of course Arnie. But then the second one came out and people bitched... oh it’s no way as good as the 1st, or when the cross over with the aliens came out you had the fucking geeky melts bitching and whinging about how it’s not following the comics religiously and the movies are a joke! For fuck sake...  the movie predators I thought was awesome but people still slagged it off and said it was a joke. Now with this movie the bollocks has started again. Any movie with the predator in it is great, his or their presence on screen, that cackle, the cloaking device, his array of weapons.... just the sheer brutality of his killing is just brilliant. None of the movies stories have sucked, none of them have made you want to fall asleep or walk out, and you are left with a smile on your face after a bit of escapism.

Have fans wondering what can toss this thing around like that. Further more. Less is always more. So this is some big government operation. We have caught on to them and we have been tracking them and learning about them. Yay it's predators two reskinned. So here is the movie. Alian ship crashes to earth. Mutant thing escapes. More predators come to clean up and special forces team is sent in to clean up. Big fights insue people die. We lose ground. Scramble to clean up the mess and the team is improssioned for knowing to much. The break lose. Main character goes back to save his family and wins the day by being a bad ass of sacrifices himself to save those he loves...... Oh and the ending is kept a vauge as possible so we can get predators three back to the jungle or some such...... Pull a tremor's on us......

Good thing my kid wasn't watching this with me . The original didn't have to have profanity every two seconds like so many movies do these days . I mean is it really necessary ? It won't help with the plotline or anything else but hey it makes people sound """"tough"""" -- right ?  The first two are still the best ,but that's just my own opinion . Sorry but I'm just getting sick of reboots that end up failing and sequels several years after the fact . Terminator is a good example of this . It should have been 1-2-3 done but it got dropped ,then picked up by different people with ambitious plans and then dropped again for years and then again picked up with more planned and now dropped again probably for good unless James Cameron acts on his promises to do another one.  For years fans have wanted to see how the story ends with the all out final battle between machine and man but we only get glimpses and then more present day scenarios and once again a planned reboot .   How about doing something creative and original for a change and if they're going to make a series of movies ,finish the damn things and move on ?  Case in point Avatar . How long have fans been waiting for a sequel ? Oh thats right 9 years !! I hear they're done with most of the filming for the next few but we'll still have to wait for another 2 years because of post production and editing . Sorry but none of these actors are getting any younger and you lose momentum when you wait so long in-between films .   I can see waiting for a couple of years between films like with Star wars but a decade or more ?? That's just ridiculous .

The actors for the most part were quite hard guys, they were put through gruelling training and there was real tension and competition - a lot of big guys trying to out do each other in the gym.  The cinematography is excellent, a classical soundtrack and it's shot on film - heavy 35mm rigs, gear and tracks had to be hauled through dense jungle - even the crew were tough!.  They had to reshoot a tonne of stuff, which allowed a rare chance to review the first draft and improve it with a second shoot - they even remade the Predator character, because the first one looked ridiculous.  If Jean Claude Van Dam hadn't walked off set playing the original Predator it may never have become what it did.  Shane Black was there for all of it and one can only hope that he at least knows what magic and luck it took to produce the original.",0,0,The Fourth Wall,12-wsx1fjcg,0.08796296296296295,2018-07-03 15:41:46,True,True

If you are excited don't let the complainers tarnish your excitement. I love predator (original) and i think this one will at worst be a simple and fun movie. Given the premise i think this movie has loads of potential. From the looks of it an underdog predator vs the big dog predator. We'll have to see though. If im right then im sure We'll be getting some badass moments on top of all the carnage.,0,0,Tyler D,12-wsx1fjcg,0.10790816326530614,2018-07-16 15:47:45,True,True

A bad rip off of the original predator whose trailer I can't even bring myself to watch. What happened to the creativity of people at Hollywood. I am simply re-watching the older terminator, rocky and such. Newer movies other that the ones from Marvel series are painful to watch. The movie studios have gotten greedy and turning out movies faster than script writers can write a good script. Look at what happened to god father 3. Coppola wrote the script in 6 weeks instead of 6 months and we know the outcome. Risk taking has also disappeared.

(My favorite) *Logic*   That above was just one example...   People say stuff like ""They are too basic and make the Predator go by the same old story line"" OK, that's fine but how the fuck else is the Predator going to get to earth? Why would it come to earth? But when that fails it becomes ""They should use some different method"" And again, that's fine but what are they supposed to do change the Predator's origin completely? And don't try that ""Oh, why not go to the Predator's home planet???"" Such as: ""Cheap staff,  any body left in Hollywood who can  produce good cinema?  The lights', camera angle, actors,  and all Idea of big mutant predator is sick.  How about to show predators world, different places, and film and show predators idea,  not just shooting in small village like usual. the Original  Predator and 1st, AVP was most interesting from all the line.  all other just gun shooting in forest and village.  Just for SHANE BLACK ,  why super hitec Aliens ship always take a crash on earth, I do not fink what such super hitec war civilization like predators, have such SHIT type unsafe ships. So stupid !!!!""   Because they did... in a Movie previous to that one... ""Predator"" (2010). Guess what that bombed because of nostalgia stuck critics...

2018-09-02T18:18:14,"Dear people who hold the rights to the Predator. #predator2018  This is the second time you had extra big predators fighting regular predators.  Consider.  The Predator as a creator goes after the toughest thing it can find. In many comics it tries to match its skills with the prey. Consider how many ways there are to hunt humans.  WE HAVE SEEN jungle hunting for humans. We have seen urban hunting for humans. We have seen ceremonial right of passage hunting in Alien Vs Predator.  Here are some thoughts. 1) A predator ship shoots off an EMP on earth near a maximum security prison. A team of predators show up, their leader disarms all his high tech gadgets, the other predators guard the exits, and their leader indulges in killing the toughest serial killers mankind has to offer in a closed  space by the dozens HAND TO HAND. Protagonist:wrongfully imprisoned 20 year old and a 50 year old inmate who got arrested for weed use before it was legal and is just stuck in red tape. They are dodging the mayhem of the prison riot and the Predator thrill seeker. PREDATOR: ARENA  2) A predator comes to earth alone. He is not in jungle gear, but a sleekarmor that seems to hold a more slender frame. We see this predator go invisible, kill people, steal their identities (in the online sense and their security information), and slowly  take apart a small country through dismantling power plants, leaking sensitive information, and assassinating powerful politicians with heavy security. His only motivation is to see  how far he can slaughter people back into the stone age. Protagonist: a government agent (Like say the Serbian FBI) and a college kid terrorist he recently captured under the assumption his organization was responsible for these ""terrorist attacks"". They see their small country fall apart with no one benefitting only to realize this alien monster was only testing his limits. PREDATOR: FOREST FIRE.  3) I am stealing from a Batman crossover book on this: A family of predators are training one of their juveniles to hunt. The go to a southern town in the US, cut it off , slash the tires of all the trucks, and steal human children to act as bait so the juvenile predator can shoot fish in a barrel carving up red necks and veterans. PREDATOR: FIRST HUNT.  4) Have you ever ready up on Ghengis Kahn? He turned a nation of hunters into the world's strongest army. You know what he did at the end of his reign? Took all his warriors, cut off an area the size of a country, and let everyone hunt to their heart's content for 7 days straight everything they can shoot or stab. Have a predator General come down with a whole army, EMP the earth, select a 400 mile wide territory filled with heavily armed humans, and just have them go to town like red necks shooting rabbits.

Nowadays, you see the skinny guy charging into a predator and God only knows how at times they get out of it. The suspense in the 1987 version has not been equalled by none yet.

Poor storyline, unfolding mediocre scenes, mediocre characters without head and foot that appear in the scenes without any justification and when they try to justify them they do it in a nutshell. Everything is predictable. Use of low-level CGI (even films from the late 90s has better CGs with much more real-time movement). In the end they still try to turn the dress into a weapon of war like the Iron Man.  If they wanted to bury the franchise, they got: Congratulations !!! Total lack of respect with moviegoers.

They took those and convinced someone to give them millions of dollars to bring this to theaters. That has to be one of the single greatest achievements in human history.

The Predator film did not even have any back ground story on the predator, the plot is too fast paced and filled with unnecessary corny ass jokes. The actors in the movie have so much potential with stars like Olivia Munn and Alfie Allen.
