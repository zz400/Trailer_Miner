2015-06-08T15:20:31,"the trailer is all wrong. In reality the whale hit the Essex while all but one of the whaleboats were out hunting whales. The only reason one whaleboat crew was on the ship was because it had been damaged by a whale harpooned by that crew and that crew had gone back to repair their boat. The officer in charge of that boat had a chance to harpoon the whale from the deck after it stunned itself on the first hit but held off because it was close to the rudder. He didn't and the whale attacked and sank the ship on its second run. That's important because what inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick was the fact that the whale appeared to understand what was hunting that group of whales and retaliated. Melville took that as a metaphor for man v nature.   Also, for what its worth only 8 of the 20 crew of the Essex survived and some were eaten by the others. One was killed and eaten.

2015-09-09T19:11:20,"PG-13? So, this should be called ""In the Heart of the Hollywood Bullshit."" The whale sped along and accidentally smashed into the ship -- then, believing it to be a rival male whale, rammed again for the final blow to the Essex and left. The primary story is the crew withering away in lifeboats, guzzling their own urine, and cannibalizing the dead. Those that stayed on the island had an easier time surviving and weren't totally scarred for life from their lifeboat experience. Owen Chase survived but was fucked in the head from then on. I doubt PG-13 will do justice to a very gruesome story. Seeing how Opie is Spielberg Lite, the film will probably go as follows:   We open on Herman Melville reading Owen's ""Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whaleship Essex."" Ramp up the sweeping soundtrack as we head into the film's flashback bulk!! Have the Essex - emphasis on it being a small warhorse of a ship, rickety but still plenty of sail left in her - gallantly embarking on its whaling journey after Owen says goodbye to his sweetheart in a spew of grotesque sentimentality that rivals the ""The Perfect Storm."" The crew attempts to bag a few whales while Owen babbles about philosophy with his buddy, Matthew Joy: ""The sea is life and we are death"" ... ""The whale is us"" ... ""We're just a tiny speck in the universe out here among the ocean's giants"" ... ""Eenie meenie chili beanie!!"" He teaches the young cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, the ropes of sailing; this bond will course in the same retarded, cliched vein as ""King Kong"" (2005): ""Get yourself educated, Jimmmeee!!"" Owen scribbles in his journal about missing his sweetheart -- set to narration and maybe a flashback discussion about having children (and the guilt of how many children he has squirted into napkins). The whale appears and rams the Essex forty times. Owen personally launches 100 harpoons into the whale and dodges numerous lashes of the tail and penis. After witnessing the horror of Hemsworth's acting, the whale leaves and the ship sinks, leaving the lifeboats to drift. PG-13 thirst is quenched with a cutaway to a jar and yellow splashes (they should be method actors and slurp the real shit down), hunger sets in with growling bellies and vacant or anguished stares - sorrowful music amped to scream ""OH THE HUMANITY!!"", a squall with harrowing music that screams ""BOOGITY BOO!!"", the sun bearing down, the sea stretching forever, a mild hallucination from exposure (where he taps into the future, babbling about ""BITE BITE, SIP SIP, DO THE DEEP DISH COMBO MAMBO!!), and a nightmare of the whale returning with Owen's sweetheart stuck in its blowhole (which gives him a violent nocturnal emission that the other crew members have to clean up because he's the captain!!) They reach the island and joyful music trumpets as mostly all resources are exhausted. After battling an army of exploding pygmy cannibals, Owen decides he must get back to his sweetheart!! The lifeboats leave and a few remain on the island, both groups looking at each other to belts of violins. Another squall separates the lifeboats -- Owen must save JIMMMEEE!! Time passes and rations run low or are ruined by seawater, followed by a gut-wrenching moment when Matthew Joy dies -- Cillian Murphy's butt cheeks are too good to pass up, so he cannibalizes his friend (Isaac Cole should be the one cannibalized, but no one's heard of the actor playing him). Maybe Benjamin Lawrence is the ""token bad guy"" in the bunch that argues back and forth like Ernest Borgnine from ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Throughout everything, the young cabin boy keeps his chin up and Owen keeps his Fabio eyes on the prize!! Upon placid water, two adult whales and a few babies peacefully pass and Owen has a moment of catharsis. They are rescued and Owen reunites with his sweetheart and finds out he has a daughter -- he embraces them with a new lease on life set to John Williams or Howard Shore farting into a tuba. Afterwards, Owen profusely masturbates to get all the sea salt out of his system. The cabin boy masturbates too to get rid of his blueballs. Cut to ""Moby Dick"" in bookstores. Superimpose whatever the hell about the other boats and the islanders being saved too. THE END.",23,8,Hellzyead,b_n2CAhgPiA,-0.000199007116620753,2015-09-09 19:11:20,True,True
