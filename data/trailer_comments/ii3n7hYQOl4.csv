2017-12-10T00:38:30,"I'VE BEEN SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE AND I WASN'T EXPECTING THEM TO ALREADY HAVE A TRAILER AND HOLY HECK THE ANIMATION AND ART STYLE IS SOOOOOOO SO SO BEAUTIFUL.   I really, really love the movement here. It has a sort of ""flipbook animation"" feel, or the feeling of going between two panels while you read a comic. It's really obvious at 0:24-0:27, as well as at 0:49-0:51. I LOVE IT. And I love the ""drawn on"" effect they gave Miles' facial features too. You can see this at 0:55. Also now that I paused it there I'm just noticing the beautiful screentoned effect of the white lighting shining on Miles' face from the left, as well as the digital paintbrush texture of his suit where the color changes from blue to red. They're really playing up the fact that Spiderman is a comic-book character, and I think that's a great choice. If they decided to make the animation look too real after three Spiderman reboots, it wouldn't bring anything new to the table.  I'm also suchhhh a fan of 0:14-0:17. The movement of the clothing especially. I love how the right side of his silhouette is smooth and static and the left side is flowing.   AND THAT SHOT WHERE HE'S FALLING AND THEY HAVE THE CAMERA UPSIDE DOWN. 0:34. THAT'S SO CREATIVE AND CAPTIVATING. THE COLORS ARE SO SO SO BEAUTIFUL IN THIS. I already know it's going to be my favorite movie of the year. Holy heck. The detail of the city, especially everything between 0:10-0:14, feels like an actual city. Too often in animation, cities have a sort of clean, candy feeling to them, and I've yet to see an animated city so beautifully urban, so wonderfully NEW YORK as it is here.  And 1:07. WHEW GOLLY DANG. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SHOT. Edit: Also, I'm loving the ""blur"" effect. It's not truly a ""blur"" but like the effect when printer colors are misaligned.",5,0,Aria U,ii3n7hYQOl4,0.35660953160953157,2017-12-10 00:38:30,True,True

I just feel like the whole, Spider man number 2 thing is holding him back. Peter Parker will always be the original Spider man, Miles being one of many Spidermans & having Perter Parker as a mentor, makes Miles feel like a fan-character, a REALLY AWESOME fan character, but not as original or iconic as he could be. Miles doesn't have his own powers or suite, he seems like a unique character in another White comic book character's shadow.    If Disney does buy the Xmen from Fox, Fox is looking to sell, I'm hoping we get an BlackPanther meets Storm meets Miles event. In the Static Shock cartoon, Static meets Anansi, an Orisha God.    The animation styles reminds me of Disney XD's Tron: Uprising. I loved that cartoon, sucked it got cancelled.

Spider-verse is a big story, and one that, with everything about to happen in the MCU, would make the MCU feel far more chaotic than they want it to. In this animated, non-canon format, they experiment a little and di what they want without having to worry about screwing up ""the continuity.""   Personally, I like it. This trailer presented to me a direction I honestly didn't see coming, and I kind of like it. Now please Sony, don't cannibalize it. Give us a comic book movie. The art is clearly gorgeous, now give the same thought and effort into the writing and give us a good animated comic book movie.",59,3,Alex Mazurek,ii3n7hYQOl4,0.17934491978609626,2017-12-10 05:44:36,True,True

2017-12-11T14:01:58,"My one fear with this is that Sony is going to repeat their past mistakes by focusing on world building over the actual substance of the script, as they did with the other movies. This is alluded through the title ""Into the Spider-Verse"" and one of title cards that played during the trailer ""Enter the Universe."" This is an entirely new Spider-Man to audiences. Isn't it more important to focus with the character first, rather than explore the depths of the Spidey-Verse, which is arguably one of Spider-Man's best story line concepts, requiring the character to already be established to really get the irony that is created through the contrasts between the Spider-Men. Still, the animation does look great, and there is quite a bit of visual story telling with the character design of Miles, so this could still work.

He’s been getting Spider-Man stories since 2011  Peter Parker’s death in the ultimate Spider-Man comic series is a key part of Miles Morales origin so don’t be so surprised that u saw his grave  No that is not deadpool in the beginning it’s the prowler, which is Miles’ uncle Aaron Davis.

2017-12-11T15:25:26,This is an interesting project.  I suspect the purpose is to test how audiences respond to Miles and gauge whether it's worth replacing Peter in a future film.

I grew up watching Tobi McGuire's Spiderman 1,2 and 3 so I originally thought that was the original... buy now all I see is Peter Parker's having built some inventions for web slinging and stuff, I just wanted to ask does the real Spiderman (I know they all are hit in terms of original cause win confused with marvels universe and timelines/events and stuff) have actual webs inside him or does he need a invention for the webs? Like once he gets bitten by the spider, does he grow tiny hairs on his fingers and have actual webbing come from his wrist or just his suit and inventions? And my second question is since miles is a spin off and Peter died HOW IN THE WORLD DID MILES GET PETERS POWER? I'm definitely missing something here cause I saw someone say something about all the Spiderman's having different abilities and not just some costume change or special change but I'm honestly confused. Did miles have an accident? Or did he find another spider? Does he not have any powers and instead has inventions for everything? Like his suit gives him amplified strength, stickiness and webs?

To be honest, when Marvel went total SWJ they made several new black “spin off” super heroes. This is an example of one.

2017-12-12T10:42:41,I’d be more interested in this if it was live action. I kind of feel like this is Sony trying to compromise with fans by giving them a Miles Morales Spider-Man movie without having to give him the full live action treatment. They want our money but they don’t want to give us what we really want so they’re hoping that this is good enough. I mean they're giving Venom HIS OWN live action movie but you know screw Miles! Heck I'd love to see any of the other cool Spider-Men get the live action treatment. Anyway I’ll probably watch it when it’s on a streaming service. I’m not convinced that it’s worth a trip to the theater. Maybe after Peter’s run as Spider-Man in the MCU Miles or one of the other Spider-Men will get the proper movie treatment they deserve. 😕,1,2,BiasDouglas,ii3n7hYQOl4,0.20686758893280632,2017-12-12 10:42:41,True,True

He is too young.No one cares about child Spider man. 5. He is black. (There is nothing wrong with him actually being black it's just bad timing.

A black kid that is noticed as Spider-man in the ULTIMATE Universe. He takes AFTER Peter Parker's death. As you can see in the trailer above, Miles is standing at Peter Parkers TOMBSTONE. Year dated 1991-2018. Pretty sure that's enough evidence that this movie takes place in Miles Universe. NOT PETER PARKERS. So for those who think Peter Parker is Black, I don't think you should watch this movie. UNTIL, you read the comics. Just putting this out there that Miles Morales is BLACK. NOT PETER PARKER.

It's so obvious that Sony is trying to show off that he's black, saving the unmasking for the end with building up music, it's pathetic and almost racist how Molly coddled minority's get treated, it's obviously such an achievement to have a black superhero 😔  Ah well, as long as the movie is good which it does look to be and it would open many more opportunities with spiderman movies...

Now here's the thing, and stay with me because you might get confused. The Peter Parker in that grave isn't the main true Peter. That's ultimate Spider-Man. Let me explain, back in the later 2000s Marvel decided to make a comic line separate from their main 616 World. It was dubbed the ultimate universe. The purpose was to revamp and update Marvel characters to a more modern time. So in the ultimate universe, Peter Parker dies. Then later Miles Morales takes up the role of the new ultimate Spider-Man in the ultimate universe.

There are multiple universes in the comics, thus multiple Earths. Now on Earth 616, in which all major storylines and cannons take place. And also which the MCU is mainly based off. Peter Parker is Spider-Man, whereas in Miles Morales' universe (Ultimate Universe) Peter is sadly killed off... And a lot of fans were super pissed. So in Miles' universe he is Spidey. Whereas in the official universe Peter Parker is still your ""Friendly Neighborhood Wallcrawler"". Other examples of Peter Parker not being Spider-Man. Are Spider-Gwen in which, Peter is dead. And Gwen Stacy if you remember Peter's dead girlfriend. Is her universe's Spider-Man. Whereas in 616 she's unfortunately dead, after Peter snaps her neck trying to save her... Next Spider-Girl, in her universe Peter and Mary-Jane are married. And have a daughter May "" Mayday"" Parker. Peter is forced to retire as Spider-Man.

The animation actually is a huge letdown. choppy framerate, cheesy overused CGI stylings, and mundane average directed shots that have been on a  repeated loop through modern animated feature films as of the last 10 years. Was hoping for traditional animation at best, with real heart. not this cold machine produced mess. sorry folks but is this is eye candy ill avoid the cavity. I'm speaking strictly of animation here as an animator myself, storyboard director and comic artist. Good work to those who worked hard on it but the final product leaves a lot to be desired. trying too hard guys...no suspense or feeling of real agility here... The story could be great which is what we are after, but again, this animation just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Will watch, but defintly do not agree that the animation is anything wonderful. Progression and higher budgets seem to just produce more average or cold results in the field these days...

2018-10-08T15:11:47,"Let us forget possible agendas. Let us forget what age we live in for a second. The age of ""information."" Really I think we often miss the point of what power and responsibility truly mean... We ALL have an opportunity TODAY to be better. To actually make the world a better place. Sure you won't have super powers doing it, but you have power inside of you... You have power around you. The power of human connection. The power of choice. The power to believe and to do. Intentions aren't enough... you have to mean it by doing and leading by example. ""The idea was to be a symbol. Batman, could be anybody. That was the point."" ""You know Zorro... could be anybody."" These things mean something to me. I will live my life knowing that I am not held back by what others think and will NEVER stop someone from doing something that they believe in or think is right. Should there be a black Spider-Man? The answer is simple. What does it matter? As long as the individual is helping people because they have been given the gifts, or resources, or knowledge, or strength OR WHATEVER it might be. That is what matters. That is the point. This is like... the first time I have ever written a YouTube comment. I'm not on the internet constantly fighting losing battles with trolls. Honestly, I will probably bring some of them out of the woodwork. I'm just tired... I am tired of seeing people divided, and I will remain tired, because people will always be people. People aren't perfect. Life is hard. Batman never could win the War, neither could Spider-Man or any of our heroes. But they did it anyway. To the people who genuinely care about superheroes and about comics and the movies and games and childhood memories, and the God damned lessons they taught all of us. I say this. a Hero comes in many shapes and sizes, and in this day and age. I believe all of us. All of us different shaped and sized, and colored, and spoken people. Have heroes inside of us. Otherwise who could put up with this bullshit? So go out there. Do some good, make our heroes... who exist only in our own hearts... proud. YouTube fighting about race or corporation agendas, or politics or which movie sucks and doesn't suck and how ""They ruined Spider-Man."" is the last place Peter Parker would want you to be.",3,2,Marcelo Sepulveda,ii3n7hYQOl4,0.1357933732933733,2018-10-08 15:11:47,True,True
