It reminded me of it because you can kill people using the box but with this movie, it is a lot less complex and the box can just give you 7 things that you want. It also reminded me of Death Note because they found the box in an unlikely place, just like the note book. I haven't seen the movie because it's not out yet but I also believe the main character doubted the ability of the box until she wished for the girl to rot, just like in Death Note when Light wrote the name of the serial killer(I think) who then died like six minutes later. Idk this movie, contrary to popular belief(or unpopular belief) just doesn't seem like it isn't 50% copied from something.

I like how the main girl receives this creepy chinese music box and she can have 7 wishes. But everytime she makes a wish, someone will die. There is also another twist which I shall not reveal. The death scenes are creative, like those from the ""Final Destination"" movies. My favourite has got to be the elevator death scene because it's so intense and scary. You have no idea who is going to die next. It's either the father or one of the best friends because the editing plays around you and put you at the edge of your seat. I mean, you have to see it for yourself. The way the elevator came crashing down, it's so frightening.  Another death scene that involves hair getting stuck in the sink razor with no chance of escaping is pretty good too. I like how the movie explores the backstory of the music box. Anyway, the main girl thought she outsmarts the music box but it didn't turn out that way at all.....When the movie concludes, you will feel sad and sorry for the main girl.....

That will give u 7 wishes. Every wish she makes she loses someone she loves. The music box is trying to tell her stop wishing or u will lose the loved ones. U must be thankful for what u have. So it kills the ones she loves. And then she gets mad and her 7th wish was to go back to the day her dad found the thing. When she did she went and got the music box before him. She gave it to her friend to Barry it. When she was leaving a car that wasn't surposed to hit her hit her. And it did. And the car hit her because when the girl made all 7 wishes the box didn need her anymore. And it went after her and killed her. I hope this helped!!!
