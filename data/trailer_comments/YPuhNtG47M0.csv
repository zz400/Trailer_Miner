2019-08-20T16:53:18,"Disappointing trailer the footage they show isn't that much exciting as in the previous trailer with a dark version of the old town road song, most of it is already shown in the previous trailer mixed in with some little bit of new footage that didn't need to be shown at all like when the Spanish girl gets drugged and kidnapped as to why he comes out of retirement or when the Cartel pulling up to his house as he busy preparing his boobytraps in his barn and house and tunnel catacombs and a scene reminiscent of Rambo 3 scene where he talks on the walkie talkie threatening the cartel leader that he's dealing with to scare him, a scene where he carries the spanish girl out of the apartment complex that she's being held hostage in and footage from the previous films like First Blood part 2, Rambo 3 and 4 with an old projector film tape filter effect with Trautman lines dubbed in there talking about what  Rambo is capable of and how much of a expert war warrior that he is with flashback glimpse of the scene when he was younger getting ready to stab Murdoch in the face with his iconic knife as he pin him down to his office desk in First Blood Part 2 to his older self doing the same, the way how this trailer was put together felt more like a TV spot than a real second trailer, it should have been renamed Rambo: Last Blood TV Spot #1 instead and this trailer honestly compare to the teaser already giveaway 97% of the whole plot three act structure of the film and i terms of action set pieces I believe it's only going to be that sequence where he kills them left and right at his house home alone style with weapons and boobytraps, the only thing they haven't show is the ending on whether he lives or dies (Like Logan) which Lionsgate will possibly show it in a TV spot without any of us noticing or maybe just maybe the ending could be that scene where he stabs that guy he have hanged up in his barn and if so what's the point of going to the theater to see it now ?

That said, this film seems completely out of sorts compared to the first four. Rambo's always been about this history-less, stoic soldier who does not get attached to anyone except his CO, Trautman. From the very first film almost no reference has ever been made to Rambo's pre-Vietnam history. This has been a defining feature of the character - the idea that one could believe that he came out of the womb with that killer instinct, that you could never imagine him as a child, with family, happy. That's what made the final shot of the postbox in Rambo 4 so jarring - it was meant to represent Rambo ending his war and finally finding peace.",0,0,jamyskis,YPuhNtG47M0,0.20681818181818182,2019-08-21 09:22:29,True,True

When the title says 'Rambo: Last Blood' I'm reminded of Friday the 13th Part IV: The FINAL Chapter hehe and how many films did they make AFTER 'the FINAL chapter' you ask? Five or six. What did they have in common? THEY ALL SUCKED. Americans need action movies and fictional war heroes like John Rambo to distract themselves and the world from one simple fact. They haven't won a war since World War Two. Got their asses handed to them in Vietnam (despite far superior technology and numbers and all the rest) and what they did in the Middle East was a fucking disgrace.

Fans hope one day it will be released on DVD. 4) Rambo First Blood Part II made over $300 million Internationally against a $44 million budget. 5) Rambo Last Blood made around $91 million against a budget of $50 million, however that excludes DVD/blu ray, etc sales.",0,2,CloudsBeyond,YPuhNtG47M0,0.22211538461538463,2020-02-22 11:21:42,False,False
