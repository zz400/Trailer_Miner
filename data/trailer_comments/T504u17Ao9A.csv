2017-06-01T05:52:59,"In 1897, Queen Victoria celebrated her Diamond Jubilee - the first British monarch to do so. But beyond the grand celebrations on London's streets, a war was raging between Victoria and her court over her relationship with her Indian servant Abdul Karim. Victoria's friendship with her Scottish servant John Brown is a familiar story. Her relationship with Karim is less well known but produced even greater shockwaves in the palace. Originally one of two Indians selected to join the Queen's household, Karim rose from being a humble waiter to become Victoria's most intimate confidant. He introduced her to the delights of Indian cuisine, fed her romantic visions of India, and became her 'Munshi' or teacher, giving Victoria daily lessons in Hindustani. Their relationship violated Victorian taboos of race and class as well as stoking bitter jealousy in the royal household; Karim was showered with honours and promoted over the courtiers whose families had served the royal family for generations. The presence of a Muslim at the heart of the British court even threatened to destabilise the politics of Empire itself. A crisis point was reached in the summer of 1897 in a dramatic confrontation between the Queen and her family, which threatened to plunge diamond jubilee celebrations into chaos. The film features interviews with relatives of both Victoria's household and Abdul Karim, as well as extracts from Victoria's diaries and journals.",1989,37,Josephsf1,T504u17Ao9A,0.16176470588235298,2017-06-01 05:52:59,True,True

No doubt that General Dyer, was an absolute cunt, but I would like to ask them, why are we people still the mere spectators of the brutality which has completely destroyed our beloved Kashmir? Why is the government mute on this? Why are we only capable of insulting the British, notwithstanding the fact that British administration was the best form of administration of that era. The British gave us the railways, they brought us 'English', they brought us industries and not to forget 'cricket'. I am not a dumb piece of shit who believes that the British were Gods or heavenly creatures, all that I know speaking in 2017, is that i would have preferred to have been a citizen of ""''British India"""" instead of simply INDIA. I honestly believe the British should have destroyed all the structures which they had built in cities like Calcutta, Bombay, Madras etc., and should have never even built New Delhi before quitting. Imagine, no GATEWAY OF INDIA , INDIA GATE , RASHTRAPATI BHAVAN, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, HOWRAH BRIDGE, VICTORIA MEMORIAL and so on. That would have actually meant complete Independence.

These dumbasses are completely new to the concept of complex movies depicting reality of history, no matter how harsh or bad it was. Our movie industry mostly caters to horny, rapacious and absolutely dumb males mostly, which is where these shameful dummies come from. They don't know that art and performance has to be appreciated.  They also have really shitty knowledge about history (our education system is a catastrophic failure). As a historian it is even more embarrassing. They are not known to think logically and hate and cry and scream just because someone mentioned something they dislike.  Most of these douchebags come from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, two infernal shitholes where education and basic human logic capacity is absent. A large number of these are freeloaders who received internet access rather recently and burst their hateful, brainwashed bubbles.

2017-10-11T09:32:57,"Although I agree that there a probably many elements of this movie that are problematic (I haven't seen it, though), those who are criticising it are missing the point; although it would be great if there was an English or Hollywood film about British colonialism and it what it did to India, that simply isn't the prerogative of this film. The story between Victoria and Abdul is little known among the British people and during a time where widespread racism against Indians and Pakistanis, particularly those of which are Muslim, is absolutely rife and abhorrent means that this film has an important message to deliver to British people still. Now, you could argue that a racist would never go to see a film with ""Abdul"" in the title, but for those fence-sitting racists, if it makes an effect and the life of some Asian people becomes a little easier at school or in the workplace, I'd say it was worth it. Anything that shows Muslims in a good light within the mainstream media is unfortunately extremely rare right now, so anything that makes a concerted effort to do so (although whilst still being problematic in some ways) deserves to be supported, because it's 100% better than the anti-Muslim not-so-subtle brainwashing driving fear and division that is in so much of mainstream movies and TV.",0,0,Bandit Moon,T504u17Ao9A,0.15806277056277057,2017-10-11 09:32:57,False,True

2018-03-26T21:51:46,VERY misunderstood film. Most of the critics probably haven't even watched it.  It's a pity people- many of them bitter Indian neo-nationalists and guilty white lefties- were so dismissive without even bothering to be objective  They say it is an apologia for imperialism.  Actually throughout the film there are clearly references jabbing at British hypocrisies among other things.   It was primarily about the historic relationship between Queen Victoria and Abdul Karim and in my view it done a pretty good job.

2018-09-22T18:56:51,"Fellow Indians, calm your fucking tits, please. There is no propaganda here. No movie can make us forget that the British empire looted our wealth and massacred our people.   Try and understand how the monarchies work, you are born into it. The position the Queen found herself in is similar to arranged marriage in a heavily patriarchal Indian household. The burden of obligation and duty is too compelling to get out of. Queen Victoria seems to have suffered through it as did Princess Diana.   The movie clearly shows how drawn away she was from the ground realities of her reign, including the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. It highlights the friendship between two individuals whose come from sharply contrasting backgrounds. The racial bias prevalent at the time is prominently shown too.   Also, we like to think that the British divided us. They simply exploited the caste divide that continues to be an ugly blot on our culture. Annual celebrations by Dalits of the British victory at The Battle of Koregaon is a shining example of how they did it. A good chunk of the British army at the battle was made up of Dalits. Dalits saw the battle as an opportunity to avenge cruelties like untouchability and slavery practiced by Koregaon's Peshwa rulers, who were a Deshastha Brahmin faction.",0,0,sundave912,T504u17Ao9A,0.020312500000000004,2018-09-22 18:56:51,False,False
