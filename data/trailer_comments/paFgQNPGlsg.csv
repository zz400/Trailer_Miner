Then I find out now it's a true prequel to the Conjuring, which will surely disappoint many! If I had known it was a prequel, would I have accepted it more? I don't know. I doubt it. Doll related horror movies have been done far too many times too, so unless you havent watched muched horror other than modern, this is nothing new and more of a hopeful cash cow.   The 'scary moment' screams, sounds, and flash effects, being grabbed and dragged along the floor-nothing new. The whispering at the start trying to be scary is slightly laughable. The doll didn't even blink or twitch once to give more of a hint as to what it was about. On the plus side, the cut down version of the trailer on here is slightly better.",5,6,MrVidification,paFgQNPGlsg,0.1170875420875421,2014-10-09 23:09:51,False,True

I’m a fan of the Conjuring as it was a film that made me think the art of a horror movie is back. First off… this isn’t made by James Wan… it’s made by it’s filmographer so off of the bat you’re probably going to get some cool scenes but perhaps lack of character development. The budget of Annabelle is $5 million (that’s 1/4 of what the Conjuring cost). Let me tell you the script is the weakest part of this film. The movie starts off slow… this is where the film should really get you into the characters but there isn’t much here, it’s generic. It’s the weakest part of the film. You have your standard couple… man goes to work, woman stays home and experiences weird stuff. The problem with this is that it’s hard for you to bother to relate to the characters. This kind of kills the film for me. There were actually a lot that could have been explored but they didn’t touch like the kids in the apartment. Now the good. There is very little CGI – perhaps none. It’s all old school. This is something that anyone could actually film…. chair moving, oven is on, someone standing there. It’s good. It works. There’s a great scene here with a baby. Are there enough scares? Not really. The pay off for the film felt like they might have fixed the movie for censors but even though the film is Rated R. There’s a lot missing in this film. It’s not horrible. It’s worth a rental. It’s your average horror movie.",1,0,Emerah Marie,paFgQNPGlsg,0.09054989550679204,2016-02-13 09:06:51,False,False

Just bring the idols of Hindu dieties at home. Perform puja and thats it. Even if u do puja just with the incense stick then ur house is purified instantly. Simply circumference the house with the burning incense stick that was used to do puja. Dispose off the puja waste in river or beside a plant where no one can step over it.  Just remember that no puja should be done if the female in the house is having her periods. Puja should not be done if someone in the house has consumed meat or eggs. Of course you can do puja before eating meat or eggs. In case someone has died recently, puja should not be done for atleast 15 days from the date of death of such family member  Rest leave on God. He will get you rid of evil spirit. Just do puja quite often if not daily.",10,4,holloween wishes,paFgQNPGlsg,-0.08333333333333333,2018-04-11 06:12:04,False,False
