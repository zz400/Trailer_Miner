2018-03-26T02:52:34,"The existence of God is this.   When I was an atheist, I asked God to prove Himself to me. I wanted to see if the Creator of the Universe would respond back.  I kept on praying to the Creator of the Universe. Eventually, He spoke through me.   How did He speak through me? There are no voices in my head. None. This Spirit inside of me is like a fire and ice blended together. This is what it feels like.  He spoke through me. I do not know what the next word will be, but, nonetheless, the words are coming out of my mouth.   He says He is The I Am That I Am.  I did not believe it was God.    I still asked for the Creator of the Universe to respond back. A month later He did.   A two-story tall, one story wide Spirit with immense pulsating energy came towards me. It was hitting the outside of my skin. It had pulsating vibrational energy, and, it was getting immensely stronger as the Spirit came towards me. I became afraid and asked God to go away. I thought I was going to die. It immediately disappeared. No more pulsating vibrational energy outside my skin.   That was the Spirit of God.     One day, God showered me with pulsating vibrational energy. He wanted to talk through me to my colleague. And He did. I do not know what the next word will be, but nonetheless, the words are coming out of my mouth. God said, “I am right here.” Those words were the answer to my colleague's question.    Some time has passed again and a man, as I was telling Christians that they are praying to the wrong God, went against me.  He called my God the Imy Imy and said that the giant spirit of Donald Trump needs to grab my crotch etc etc. God, in his life, immediately responded back. To this day, he refuses to talk to me anymore.    Some time has passed, and I told God to go f Himself. My life got worse. I told Him I hated Him. My life got worse.  A man I know prayed and bowed down to a dragon statue. He lost his wife, his job, and his house.     A woman that believes in the same God as me felt the push in her mind. The push was to call her friend.   She did not want to. She thought it was bizarre to do so. Then, God, The I Am That I Am, lifted her out of her chair and placed her on the floor.  She immediately called her. Her friend had one hand full of pills and was about to commit suicide.   The woman on the phone cried out to God to have someone call her or she will commit suicide.  My God answered her prayers.     Prophecy is this. God, The I Am That I Am, will speak through a prophet. The prophet does not know what the next word will be coming out of his mouth, but the words are being said by God through that prophet.  God inside of the prophet is like a fire and ice blended together. This is a sensation that the prophet can feel when God wants to speak through him or her. He or she is never desensitized by it.  And, God, 95% of the time, will talk about that person's sin that He is speaking to.   Any prophets who claims to be a prophet, but does not do what I described above, is a false prophet.  This is true prophecy that no one has experienced today, because Christians are praying to a made-up God of Love or Jesus as a God that has no power.     God is The I Am That I Am, the One who sent Jesus His Son only, and the One who brought the Israelite out of slavery.   You have to sit still, listen for The I Am That I Am for 30 to 40 minutes, and He will push your sins in your mind. He will squeeze you from the inside-out. It will be unbearable unless you confess your sins. This is not meditation, and this is not a psychological bias. This is physical. You have to open your heart up and this will happen.  Ask my God to prove Himself to you every day. Just seek my God, The I Am That I Am. Eventually, He will respond back through circumstances and events in your life and it will be obvious. This takes time. Just keep on asking Him to respond back.     We cannot continue in sin; in all sin.   God will bring America, the Queen, to Her knees, again.",1,0,Gods Auxiliary,aNvRdg1lR7c,-0.022157872157872134,2018-03-26 02:52:34,True,True

2018-04-06T09:04:25,"It should have been shot with the same camera effect as Black Dynamite. The real 1973 script was developed by the game. The Game some how was spirtually interpreted by Sig Shore who were able to regurgitate the game in an accurate precision. Ron o neal Played the role of Priest. kids were named after this movie. character taught to watch it and bump the soundtrack. Mayfield expressed the theme which is a source of meditation right until this very date. He captured the harlem world the essence the vibe of hustling in the air. He was very strategic and considerate of the culture. The orginal 1973 Superfly film wasnt thought up and wrote out by a bunch of script writers in an office. It was brought about by his spectacular insight and observatience of the actual game. He upheld the image in a respectable way. Like nowadays they cant make up there mind as to uphold the image of the hustler pimp on Black Dynamite and be serious or do they want to make it a comedy a silly nigga film. Real exploitation was designed to give imaginary heros to the oppressed people at the time for means to escape temporarily. ""Sticking it to the man"" they say Black Dynamite was pitched by a guy who had a photographic memory for blaxploitations they gave him a budget and a timeframe without even a script. Thats the type of stuff i like to hear about or want to do myself. He did a great job at making it look filmed in the 70s but he made a quick lssac Haye ""shaft""  Didnt uphold the pimps players and hustlers image. Most writers these days are either going to destroy defamate the image with a comical impression or uplift this hustlers image or any images of ghetto super stars with seriousness. It depends on what type of depiction you want to project. SIG shore had no bias no agenda he soaked up game like as if he was a hungry black kid raised in the streets of Harlem himself. I think Dynamite would be a hit if I wrote the story. But he did a good job with giving it the 70s feel plus characters like Chicago wind but they make stuff funny goofy. Which is why its not a huge blockbuster. Hustle and Flow was realistic not pimp bashing biasness. So far what i feel about this trailer? good idea but looks to futuristic. Space age hustling. Hair. People dont know what trap music is. They are mixing it up with Mainstream rap. Trap is Jeezy underground. TRAP is dopeboy rhyme before they are signned. Trap is Scarface ghetto boys, Ice T ""6 in the morning"" Kool G Rap and Polo Ice cubes Dope man before there were a such thing as the slain term trap. Trap is ""All star and Young Paper"" check out there song called ""Whip game"" once they are signed and gone mainstream they are then considered mainstream. Trap rappers who have gone mainstream. They are confusing it with a Genre. Like i loved the movie sequal Roots but when they went back reshot the Movie again with new rappers it takes away from the old one. Thats my only concern.  Why would they name it Superfly? Why must will smith play Muhummad Ali? Why wont they give Richard Pryor son some shine? Made sure they let us know he was booed on Appollo. Im hoping finally a film were theres not an image agenda. Sounds like finaly a film where a brother gets over.
