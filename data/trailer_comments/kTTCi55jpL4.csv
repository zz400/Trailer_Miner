2016-06-04T08:11:52,"The upcoming movie ""The Conjuring 2"" is based on a true story. However the majority of events, scenes, plot, and theme in this movie are Far-fetched. After watching the trailer for this movie and reading about the true story of the Enfield Haunting, I must say there is a lot of Hollywood in this film. Which is not uncommon in films based on true stories but the trailer for this movie is way too misleading. For instance if you were to rate the Enfield Haunting event VS The Conjuring it would not be rated R. Also, two of the main actors in this film are Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson who play the part for Lorraine Warren and Ed Warren. However Ed and Lorraine Warren had little to none in investigating the Enfield Poltergeist case.",0,0,Winn Spivey,kTTCi55jpL4,0.10486111111111109,2016-06-04 08:11:52,False,True

2016-06-12T03:09:38,well what can I say I watched this movie last night and I am compelled to say that this is one of the best horror movies I've ever watched. I really felt for the main characters and felt their pain and fear to the point of having tears in my eyes at certain really demonic and sad parts. there are some happy beats along the way which help to receive the viewer of some of the stress that builds up constantly as the film progresses. I give this movie a solid 9/10 on a side note the movie is long but never stops giving and doesn't feel like there is many unneeded scenes there are many scares and some extremely unexpected ones. I give this film my seal of approval and recommend it to be seen in theatres. well worth that coin folks!,0,0,ShootEmUpSteve,kTTCi55jpL4,0.23373015873015873,2016-06-12 03:09:38,False,True

(It's not like, ""Hey, this is my name, you can use it to kill me."" MEH -_-) 4 How did the Demon possess Bill? (I mean it makes sense if she possesses human, but possesses the same spirit?
