Did you also know their beef is so low grade they named the beef supplier "" 100% Beef "" to keep you believing in quality assurance. McD's is an evil company whose crimes are covered up by big money, tons of high power lawyers and an advertising campaign that constantly bombards us with promises of good times & wannabe Americanism.
