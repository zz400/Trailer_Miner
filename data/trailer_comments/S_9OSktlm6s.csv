I'll probably watch this one too, maybe even in theatres, and I rlly rlly hope they make it like the book. Now, u can say I'm just whining and complaining and that it doesnt matter if the movies aren't like the books but Idc. If u feel like this comment is offensive, then read the books, u will feel the same way. And if u don't, well then just ignore me and keep thinking I'm just a complaining little brat. But  just saying, if movies r based off of books, then they should b at least similar. The first too were completely different, even parts of the plot were off. As a book reader, I think that books and movies shouldnt b completely different from eachother.

2017-09-26T02:33:55,Here's the reason why I like this trailer: they gave us very little which is good because most movies will have all their huge action scenes cut into the trailer luckly by the looks of it it looks like there's one train action sequence and that's the only actual action sequence that happens in this trailer also all the clips from the new movie are about 45 seconds long if you take out all the stuff from the first and second movie and all the title stuff then that leaves it only little over 40 seconds of actual clips from the new movie so I like how they're just really teasing us even though this is an official trailer trailer it's a good idea that they did this,134,2,DV Studios,S_9OSktlm6s,0.14955143540669857,2017-09-26 02:33:55,True,True
