But fuck it I don't want my daughter a part of this family even though they like her and seemed to think that she's an okay person. In the future mother-in-law thinks I was okay for raising Aurora but no throw all that shit out the window and just decide to attack them.,0,2,wolf bane,yL1f8yNxGBk,0.09677083333333332,2019-07-11 03:36:53,True,True

2019-07-12T08:30:06,"I love how the title seems to already make Maleficent a villain but I've never seen her that way, and I don't think the movie will make her seem evil either. Sure she overreacts, but she's seen firsthand what mankind can do when it comes to manipulation and love. So when her real love, Aurora, is seen to find love with the same kind of royalty who hurt her, of course she'll be suspicious. Especially since the Queen seems to harbor extreme hatred for Maleficent and non-humans, and isn't willing to set that aside for the sake of her son. I think at the end of the day, Maleficent believes that her method of lashing out wasn't just to defend the possible threat on her daughter, but the threat on non-human kind.   With Maleficent meeting her kind though, I think they're going to try to prevent her from interacting with humans or her home again. And in return, she'll either lash out and hurt them or make some kind of deal. But I bet she'll be some kind of special version of her kind, so they may regard her as a version of royalty.",0,0,natia456,yL1f8yNxGBk,0.32400793650793647,2019-07-12 08:30:06,True,True

Angelina Jolie is #pizzagate, #hotdoggate, #pedogate, #rapegate, #crushvideogate, #bestialitygate and #aidsgate. She loves to brag about the rape parties, breaking into peoples homes with scientologists to drug people up and rape them. She also has child pornography on her phone and devices like Demi Lovato and Scarlett Johansson. Law enforcement, lawyers, the judicial system and the investors know about this stuff but nothing is done as many are involved. Angelina Jolie Windsor pretends she represents the gay community but has given people aids and their families made it or modified it with the injections. Why are Angelina Jolie Windsor and Brad Pitt Windsor Rothschild children not in their 20's? They became under the age of 10 the last few years.",0,0,SyncroScales,yL1f8yNxGBk,0.1791666666666667,2019-07-24 07:56:00,True,True

Aurora would never choose Phillip over Maleficent and Maleficent wouldn’t refuse to let Aurora get married. She was the one who brought Phillip to try and save Aurora and she definitely doesn’t seem like the overprotective mother. She seems like she would let Aurora do whatever and if it all comes crashing down she’d be there to comfort her. And I definitely don’t think Maleficent would think she even had the right to make those decisions for Aurora. Even though Aurora might see Maleficent as her mother, Maleficent doesn’t. She tried to kill Aurora in the first movie and everyone sees her as the villain so she’s just happy that Aurora would ever want to spend time with her.

I like the whole ""redemption"" schtick that kind of went down in the first Maleficent, but NOTHING is more satisfying than a follow up to a redemption story. Because, no one changes on a dime. Or even after a few years. Old habits are so, so very easy to fall back on. And Maleficent is very much that sort of character who thrives while she's toeing the line between unforgivable and not. She's not a good person, but you can't say she's pure, irredeemably evil, either. And I really hope this movie can explore that depth in character growth.    Also?? I just like these kinds of characters. Characters like Orochimaru, from Naruto (yes NARUTO), that are ambiguously evil and yet show startling growth. EVERYONE changes eventually. Even people like them. Loki, Draco Malfoy (even if his character imho was sort of underdeveloped and underused for the position he could have taken as a gray character), etc etc.    (also if anyone has any other characters like these ones i'm curious to see them because I'm  always looking for new fandoms)",8,1,Luna Sidera,yL1f8yNxGBk,0.013972720401291827,2019-08-19 18:05:48,True,True

In the real world today, how does someone feel when a close person to them betrays them & cuts off their wings, metaphorically speaking, so they can't fly (thrive, succeed, reach their dreams). A very EVIL jealous person cut my wings to advance their career & took away my lively-hood, job, house, car I had to file for bankruptcy and moved back with my mom. I wish I had some magic like Maleficent to punish them. And in this movie a bitch Queen is going to try to kill her, but Maleficent will discover there are others like her out there...
