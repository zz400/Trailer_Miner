2018-01-22T02:19:41,😉 all right it's like this. straight to the point there's no way beating around the bush laughing out loud. So anyway when I was a young kid growing up I despised and I hated the Smurfs like seriously. I thought they were a joke no kidding. Also when the first two movie came out for the Smurfs I didn't even go to see them once again I thought they were joke. However when they did (( The Smurfs the Lost Village movie )) I truly loved it + I also thought it was a fantastic movie. I actually went out and bought it on Blu-ray disc like seriously I did. I don't know what it is about this movie but for some reason I truly do love it and I enjoy this one. Maybe because it's a CGI movie or what I don't know. Now if they would have made the cartoons like this back in my day then just maybe I probably would have loved the Smurfs + they also should have made the Smurfs and the Smurfs 2 movie like this as a CGI then the other two Smurfs movies would be fantastic as well. All I got to say is the Smurfs lost Village movie totally rocks + it's amazingly awesome and it's fantastically the coolest.,0,0,shawn eldridge,Q3iY8Pxyr1E,0.17600250626566413,2018-01-22 02:19:41,False,False
