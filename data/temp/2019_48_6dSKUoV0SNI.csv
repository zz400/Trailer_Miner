By the end I wanted her to die but no, of course, have to have a mixed-race character always survive because it's current year. I don't care if it's because of a genuinely good character but not just because it's 'current year' and it's so forced. What about fat dudes? They never survive horror/thriller - they never get laid, and they never get the girl or become the hero. If you want to be really progressive Hollywood, quite your woke shit and cast real actors who look like real people again, just like they always did in the 80s. And also, stop fat-shaming and let the fat guy survive, get the girl and win for once.",0,0,This Leprechaun Writes

Characters lash on to each other from the start just to add drama. Escape rooms are meant to be faced with logic and solved by working together - a movie around those two aspects would have made it so much better. The rooms themselves were interesting and had a lot of potential but underdelivered.,1,0,Erik Hoffmann

REASONS :  1- they treat the viewer as if he has an IQ of a fork like you don't need to think or analyze anything they just give you the solution of a golden plate like its seriously not the kind of movie that you are expecting it to be . 2- when you watch this crap you don't even need to use your mind like everything is soo obvious like the characters panic then they settle down then they show some flash back and then they find a clue and escape there is nothing interesting ...  3- its not realistic at all like the black guy that died in the black and white room (forgot his name) he was dead just because he was pushed against the wall and got hit in his head this is kinda realistic BUT when zoey shot the developper of the game in his back he didn't die ,as a matter of fact he didn't even feel it like WTF  4- there is nothing interesting in this movie like its too predictable and boring",1,1,Fahed M'barek

They used a trendy activity expecting no one notice everything else is the same I guess. It didn’t even succeed in being a better.

Genius really.  But we needed more on the last 3, especially Jason.... And not TOLD to us. These are important characters. Knowing a bit more about their lives will help the audience care. AND NO... not showing them solve the same cube.   The movie needed to be more self aware of what it is. It reminds me so much of 'Maze Runner' and why it fell short, though they are not the same. A  little bit of comedy relief would help in this movie. I was waiting  for someone to say ""I just met the guy, should I start crying?"" . The kind of comedy that is dark and not shitting on other people. Danny should have been more like Jazz from ""The Fresh Prince"". I did like how obsess he was with the escape rooms though. Nice touch.  Showing what happens at the beginning of the movie was the dumbest thing ever. The audience isn't stupid. We knew it would have gone either way. He either lives or dies... We knew everyone else dies. And the actions leading to Zoey possum were really predictable. This was not the way to make the movie any less linear.  If not all, most of the questions we had were answered with assumptions. Maybe hinting for a sequel... but that actually does the opposite. Not many people will want a sequel from watching this movie.  It would be great if Zoey had learned something unique from each of them. In fact I think this would have made it a better ending.  Ben should have died in the last room... with Danny's phone in his possession, hoping to bring everything to light. The psycho even more eccentric than what was portrayed in the film, explains everything to Zoey after escaping a sneak attack from her (here we get a hint of a higher power)... Gun, out of ammo, thrown to the side. Psycho then proceeds to tell her his story... His character motivation, as if putting on a show for the audience....  Walking around the sofa, Zoey grabs the mic next to the laptop. Both faced each other in anticipation. Psycho gets in close , like an anaconda, he restricts her movement. Zoey unable to move her arms, kicked and screamed.. Freed her arm and clubbed him with the mic. She then proceeded to bash his head in. Zoey escapes. Gets medical treatment. Cop doesn't believe her story and hints that he's a part of the organization ...  Last scene, Zoey waves bye at her roommate who is off to meet with friends.  She now makes her own investigation in secret and accepts the burden of being alone and the one left behind.",0,0,flat_foot

Another thing, Danny explaining that escape room is just a game and nobody is going to die which contradicts to what really happens in the escape room. He has been telling lies to other players. I am not erasing the possibility of Danny being the puzzle maker. He's naming puzzles though.

No unnecessary gore and fan services   Cons     . Characters are okay at best      . Dialogue mainly consist of shouting and yelling     . Villain motivation is pretty weak     . Weak climax and final showdown  In summary, if you love puzzle solving, mysteries, and suspenseful and thrilling atmospheres, I would definitely recommend it. However, if you’re expecting cool and interesting characters or witty dialogue, you won’t find it here. While the premise and plot is fine, don’t expecting some mind-blowing twist ending or interesting villains on par with Jigsaw from Saw...",0,0,Jinhunter Slay

El problema es que nos lo dan masticado, sin darle oportunidad al espectador de explorar otras ideas. Aún así la cinta tiene buenos momentos, personajes creíbles y situaciones apremiantes. Eso hasta el desenlace donde se cae el argumento, que termina por apurarse a apuntar a una segunda entrega, antes que cerrar oportunamente esta primera historia.  Vale la pena ir al cine a verla.",1,0,Miguel Jiménez Cervantes

I CANNOT stand these two things. So, if anyone has seen Escape Room, can you tell me if it has any of these? Like scary stuff just popping at you, or gory elements.

And in the first room they shouldn't necessarily use water to fill the cups, any object would do and there were a lot of stuff in the room. There were lots of times they could cheat.

They’ll find some way to mess this up. That’s about the only thing I’m optimistic about. Also I’m seeing comparisons to the saw franchise as well. From the trailer it does look a lot like it’s trying to be saw. Their are ways they can avoid this in the film by just making the villains of the film some sickos who just like to torment people. Kind of like welcome to the game In a way, but now that I’ve said that it’s not going to be surprising if that’s what it turns out to be.

But I must say, the ""death trap"" movie concept, even if you're specifically looking at escape room movies, isn't exactly a novel idea lol. Funny enough, all except for two of them, plus the new one, are from Lionsgate.  Cube series (1997, 2002, 2004; Lionsgate) - same general idea, but not an ""escape room,"" per se. Saw franchise (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2017; Lionsgate) - again, not an actual escape room, but it's still pretty much the same escape-or-die concept. Cabin in the Woods (2012; Lionsgate) - not an escape room, but again close in concept to one. Escape Room (2017; Global Genesis Group) - an escape room, but with a demonic killer inside. Escape Room (2017; Lionsgate) - yes, there were two movies titled Escape Room that were released in 2017. This one is more on par with the new one coming out, a Saw-inspired escape room death trap. No Escape Room (2018; MarVista Entertainment) - a SyFy movie about an escape room, but with an evil spirit inside.",0,0,Tyler Emery
