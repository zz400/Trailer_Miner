Usually he gives the same lather rinse and repeat message in his movies, but this time around he kind of gave a slap to the face of what black love should be. He kind of gave a diss towards what the older generation of women that basically tolerated failed marriages for the sanity of the family. gave a tap on the hand or the wrist to what the new generation of women tend to do when it comes to not knowing how to handle the pressure of a relationship; and overall body slam the whole aesthetic of what black love should be, because if you watched the progression of the mother she did not show much sadness compared to her children until towards the end where it was revealed that she was actually relieved and in a way happy the father was deceased.",0,0,Kenny random

2019-03-13T02:01:49Z,"According to Tyler Perry, this is  Madea's final film appearance.  If this is the best screenplay that Madea can come up with, then Madea does need to retire from films.  Madea's first couple of films were terrific...after that, each one of Madea's films became more and more Hollywood.   This one was obviously written to please the unimaginative Hollywood producers and an increasingly superficial smartphone addicted audience.  I went to see this film today at the AMC movie theatre which has wonderfully large movie screens.  The screen was much too large for this small cliché ridden film. Some of the scenes are ok, but in general this film has not much to offer in originality other than the tired old clichés of a predictable mediocre script.  But like a lot of Hollywood crowd pleasing films, the money is there to be made to line up the pockets of unimaginative executives.  I'll stick to the new foreign and independent films that are released in NYC.  They don't make much money but they are the last bastion of great cinema.",0,0,JACK ANTHONY

I can do bad all by myself. I had the last movie plan out called Madear ROCKS she go to church and learns the scripture in the Bible and brings more in. Mother Charlie Lott Walker is the best Elder in the world she is so funny and can sing you know .She can perform 😁. So hit me up. It would be your no.1 hit. I do believe and I could be a extra as well. Or Joe could be the one and we would hear  Madear voice. Can I get a Amen. Plan to attend your play in St. Louis.

Mucha gente continúa de esta manera durante la muerte de un miembro de la familia debido a los celos o la lectura de la Voluntad. Con todas las cosas deprimentes que están sucediendo en el mundo de hoy, esta película provocó risas en mi vida durante 90 minutos. No me gustó el personaje de Courtney Burrell porque era un imbécil en la película. El director de funeraria fue aterrador y divertido. Me he dado cuenta de que Tyler Perry siempre tiene un atractivo atractivo para las mujeres y los hombres gay en sus películas. Las mujeres en esta película también eran atractivas y atractivas. Incluso la madre que perdió su engaño, no un buen marido, era una mujer atractiva. Le daré a esta película un B +. La risa y la comedia son buenas para el corazón y el alma en la sociedad deprimente de hoy.

With all the depressing things that's going on in the world today, this movie brought laughter in my life for 90 minutes. I did not like Courtney Burrell's character because he was a jerk in the movie. The Funeral Director was scary and funny.  I've noticed Tyler Perry always have attractive eye candy for the women and gay men in his movies. The women in this movie were sexy and attractive as well. Even the mother that lost her cheating no good husband was an attractive woman. I will give this movie a B+. Laughter and comedy is good for the heart and soul in today's depressing society.

2019-01-30T17:16:28Z,"Hell'er, as Madea would say! I will definitely be watching Tyler Perry's ""A Madea Family Funeral."" This white broad loves Madea! I can't get enough of her! Tyler Perry is ingenious. He plays Madea, Joe, and Bryan and he is amazing plus his cast of characters are so hilarious, you can't help laughing from the belly! I got my sister-in-law hooked on Madea and I believe I bought every Madea project from Amazon.com and they're now on my video library there. I intend to buy ""A Madea Family Funeral (2019)"" when the opportunity strikes. More importantly, Tyler always has a great moral to each of his amazing stories and in every one of his projects, he mentions the name of Jesus or either Madea or one of the cast members will quote Scripture now and then. As many know, God has been pushed to the back burner or taken out all together these days. Although, there are Christian film makers, like Tyler, who promote their projects to all viewers, which is a blessing for those who wish to watch them can. I have viewed many Christian movies which are spiritually enlightening and wonderful. I watch tons of secular movies and series as well. Tyler's Madea has the best sense of humor, and the many funny lines, the stories ,and the cast, cannot be beat! Madea was a 'ho' at one time but if you listen to Tyler's messages, she gets in those digs that are sound and brilliant, and Godly. I hope to God that Tyler Perry doesn't put Madea to rest or I'm going to call 1-800-CHOKE-THAT-HO! LOL! She's a one bad 'dame,' but Joe claims she is a DUDE! LOL! Love it!

2019-01-19T23:45:11Z,"Tyler Perry used to be so funny and was rising up like Eddie Murphy with his humor touching different audiences. Never as funny as Eddie was back in the 80s ans 90s but comparing his uprising as a new Hollywood star. Old Tyler Perry was funnier. I knew Hollywood would change him. That new money always DOES. Tyler resorts back to Madea only to keep his fans happy. The old Madea was more in tune with comparing her to some people you may have encountered. This new aged Madea is just too goofy and its obvious trying to be funny, not funny at all. Tyler said in one of his plays He WOULD NEVER ALLOW HOLLYWOOD TO CHANGE HIM OR HIS SCREEN WRITING. Guess what. Wheres God in his movies now??? I was drawn to his story lines about God. God is gone as soon as he got Hollywood. Another bites the dust. No Christian writers in Hollywood. Hollywood need more God movies, all these other movies he is writing has nothing to do with God and they are just another drama or match Hollywood story lines with crime, drama and etc... Where is God Tyler??? God gave him a platform and look what he does... Wheres God at in his movies?? Hes another screen writer in Hollywood, he aint no different. I cant tell anymore, he blends right in. Thats a shame.",0,0,D DE

2019-01-18T16:53:34Z,"I agree with so many others...I did not laugh not one time watching the trailer. It’s NOT hate just because we’re not all laughing. Everyone has their preferences. Several of us prefer a deeper storyline and movie like Diary of MBW, I can Do Bad all by myself, The Family that Preys, and even the one where Loretta Divine passed away, and the siblings were fighting.   We all love Madea BUT as of late, the storyline has gotten a bit more silly and doesn’t resonate every well. Let folks have their opinion: not everyone thinks “every” movie is funny just because it’s TP. We all know he’s a Genuis but his audience is very diverse in what we all like, or don’t like. So just because someone mentions they don’t like the Trailer, wont be seeing it etc, doesn’t make them Haters! It’s makes them human. Just because you find it funny or worth seeing. Doesn’t automatically mean everyone else will. So stop with the immature comments calling people haters. That’s absurd! And believe it or not, Tyler would probably rather know the truth from his fans rather than everyone try to pretend they like every movie he puts out. He wants the constructive criticism: it’s how he evolves and gets better! So I’m sure he doesn’t mind it: he’s mature enough to know not everyone is going to like everything so stop acting like he’s ignorant and expects praise for every project! You’re the dummy if you think that’s what he wants!",0,0,Anonymous

Neither did he let the ancient ungodly world off. He wiped it out with a flood, rescuing only eight people—Noah, the sole voice of righteousness, was one of them. 6-8 God decreed destruction for the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. A mound of ashes was all that was left—grim warning to anyone bent on an ungodly life. But that good man Lot, driven nearly out of his mind by the sexual filth and perversity, was rescued. Surrounded by moral rot day after day after day, that righteous man was in constant torment. 9 So God knows how to rescue the godly from evil trials. And he knows how to hold the feet of the wicked to the fire until Judgment Day. Don’t put GOD off any longer, it is not worth going to hell, talk to him today! This is just a warning so that you have time to change. Love ya.",0,0,Marie J

Then from 26- I guess to about 40 years old, this group lives in mid-life Crisis calls 'where is the Christ!' 3. From 40 to 80 what is this_____  will one of the little Pigs be 1. No showering for days 2. No Teeth brushing for days 3. ________ I can't guess the other pig although I feel if might be to be able to wipe the backside....  Were you homeless long enough to know or experience the hardship that comes voting as a homeless.  if there be issues, ideas, WE must funeralized at the: 1. Primary 2. General election 3. Municipal election 4. special election  what might these things be... for the first time I'd had to pull out a Walmart plastic bag to stached my money in it to place it in between my breast-bar!!!   *1.

2018-11-05T20:22:16Z,"Friends, do you need wisdom? Seek it from the Source who alone can provide it—Father God. Wisdom is necessary as we decide what’s fair and moral, right and wrong. If we truly value wisdom, we can ask God, through Jesus Christ for a discerning heart. God may answer our request by helping us balance our needs and desires with the interests of others. He may also help us weigh short-term benefits against long-term (sometimes eternal) gains so we can honor Him in how we live.  Our Lord is not only a perfectly wise judge, but He is also a personal counselor who is willing to give us godly wisdom in great amounts (James 1 : 5). Seek ultimate wisdom THIS VERY MOMENT by first understanding that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and blessed abundantly with love. Your life will be forever changed!        Dear one, please take a moment to pray the following prayer with me.....Dear Heavenly Father, I worship You as the true source of wisdom. Please show me how to make choices that bring honor to Your name. This I pray in the Mighty Mighty name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, Amen! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️",57,13,msdogooder

Thank you, for all you've done for us fans/watches of both your plays and movies. Thank you for your works on OWN, and for bringing such joy to us old and new generations. If this is the end of Madea then I won't judge, criticize or curse you out on any social media. I may not know what it's like to be a famous playwright, actor or director, but I do know what it's like to be human and to want to have a break. So if you think it's time for Madea to go, then I will cry right now and learn to accept this sad fate, but by March 1st I'll be smiling and sending Madea off with a ""Hallelu-Yer"" until then! Thank you for being in my 21 (almost 22) years of my life as the crazy aunt-mother-grandmother-stripper-jailbird-countretto boss woman that we all know and love. God bless you forever for your teachings and stories. Thank you 😊🙏🏾❤️  P.S.   I hope none of you take offense to me calling Madea a  aunt-mother-grandmother-stripper-jailbird-countretto.

Those movies had (in my opinion) a stronger well thought out story and a cast that could actually act compared to the Madea Halloween movie. Edit: In the Halloween movie it's hard to take the ""serious"" parts seriously when the acting makes me cringe and I feel like its harder to connect with the characters. In that movie, I didn't care that much for the characters. With I Can Do Bad All By Myself, as an example, I was invested in April (Taraji) and the kids. I also feel like the balence between the comidic and the seriousness of the plot was great. But of course this is all just my opinion. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",1938,51,Tonisia Seth

2018-11-02T16:11:23Z,"Honestly I think you should make a movie about Madea and her long lost sister who just so happens to be her identical twin. Her twin sister Madge is not doing so well and is on her death bed and she has tried throughout the years to reach out to Madea. She finally gets ahold of her and they share so many lost memories about when they were kids, teens and young adults and about their parents and Madge invites Madea to church. Madea was in a bad car accident and has a close call with death and she converts and finds her way to repentance and to Jesus. I absolutely hate that this is the last movie with about Madea. I grew up with her in my teens and as an adult and I listen to quotes and movies on a regular.

2018-11-02T09:18:01Z,"I don't care what color your skin is... FUNNY IS FUNNY!  And let's be real here.... those of us from the south, again regardless of color,  all know someone who reminds us of Madea, just maybe not as hard core LMBO.   Not too long ago I got the ""you do realize that it's a black movie right"" from a young black guy when buying tickets for a Madea movie. My response was  ""well bless your heart. Thank you but I know what I want to see.""  He rolled his eyes but before he said anything it was at this point my husband walked up,  and the ticket seller said ""oh I see. no wonder"" and shook his head.   I was ready to pull a Madea then!  I said,  ""You see what? My gorgeous husband who happens to be black and cherokee and then you see me and think just because I am white and cherokee that he's the only reason I'm going to see this movie? Please tell me you're  really not that kind of special stupid! First of all, I am a grown ass southern woman. Ain't nobody but my mama or God going to tell me what to do or even what to watch. Second of all,  don't pull the race card on me when you are part of the damn problem. Trying to say it's a black movie like that means something. A good movie is a good movie.  And didn't you know God loves variety and that's why he made us all in these beautiful colors.  Just like if the earth was a crayola box and we're the crayons, and yes white is a color too.  You kid need a check up from the neck up and buy a clue or borrow a vowel because you just flipped my b*tch switch.""  Now,  I didn't mean to go off like that nor did I realize how loud I got.  But he hit me on the anniversary of my mama's passing and I was in desperate need of a laugh.  My mama who told me that even though we have a  colorful family (there's six races in my family), there had been  rough times and not everyone would be OK with me dating my husband (which we have had not one problem though we have had two black and two white elderly people say that it wasn't for them and they wouldn't but if we were happy then go for it)  then two weeks after meeting him told me he was the one and if I didn't marry him she was going to divorce me and adopt him and who loved watching Madea too.  Needless to say the manager came over and asked if there was a problem and the ticket seller said he didn't need this bs and how he was just trying to help me.  SMH.  I just told the manager that it was a misunderstanding but  that he needs to remind his employees that movies are for everyone of any color.   I finally got my laugh, and then some, and maybe going off helped too because I sure felt better when leaving. I was still sad, still hurting,  but I didn't feel like I was being ripped apart inside as much if that makes sense. I told what happened to me so maybe someone else reading it would think twice before assuming. We got too much real trouble to worry about then the wrapping that is on the outside of another member of OUR race....the human race.  Thanks to whomever  is reading this! Most of all, Thank you Mr. Tyler Perry for sharing your gift with the world and for bringing smiles, laughs,  and some common Madea--sense to humans of all colors.",329,25,Dorie Pope Stephens

Everyone should Read The International Jew by Henry Ford, The Protocols of The Learned Elders of Zion, The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, Israel's 5 Trillion Dollar Secret, From Babylon To Timbuktu, The Thirteenth Tribe, and Bloodlines of The Illuminati for starters. The Revelation 2:9 Caucasian synagogue of Satan jews in Israel funded slavery; they owned 90% of the slave-ships and plantations and were the main beneficiaries of the Trans-Atlantic Slave-Trade.   Zondervan’s Bible Dictionary: Ham – The youngest son of Noah, born probably about 96 years before the Flood; and one of eight persons to live through the Flood. He became the progenitor of the dark races; NOT The Negroes, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites.  The Real Hebrew are the so-called Negroes or African Americans, and those who were scattered through out the world via The Transatlantic slave-trade. Act. 7:6. Deuteronomy 28:15-68. Luke 21:24. The Negroes are the Lost Sheep of the house of Israel. 1619-2019 Biblical Prophecy Fulfilled.   Acts 7:6 Then the LORD said to Abraham, ""Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. Deuteronomy 28:15-68. Daniel 9:11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. Isaiah 42:22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. Jeremiah 17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever. Isaiah 1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. Lamentations 1:3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. Luke 21:24 They shall fall by the edge of the sword and be taken captives into all nations. Jerusalem will be trodden down by gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled. Revelations 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Revelation 3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.    Song of Solomon 1:5-6 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as black as the tents of Kedar, as black as the curtains of Solomon. Job 30:30 my skin was black upon me. Lamentations 4:8 my skin was blacker than coal. Isaiah 47:1-2 we had dreadlocks. Acts 13:1 I was called a nigger. Daniel 7:9 burnt bronze skin Revelations 1:13-15 hair like wool skin like burnt bronze. Song Of Solomon 5:11 My dreadlocks are black & bushy. Enoch was a pitch black Ethiopian. Moses married a black Ethiopian and passed for a black Egyptian and Pharaoh son. Baby Jesus, Mary, & Joseph fled to Egypt to hide. Jesus walked the desert for 40 days.
