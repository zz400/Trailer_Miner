2020-05-12T21:00:23Z,"This is killing me... :(  I took my girlfriend to see this film in November/Dec when it came out.  It moved me in *so* many different ways.  She had been suffering from Anxiety... Depression... BPD... OCD--most all of her life.  And I'd been BEGGING for her to get help, as... it was starting to take a toll on me... on us.  In January... she asked if I wanted to see it again.  I was OVERJOYED.  We went.  I cried again.  And spending time with this soulmate of mine--I have to tell you--she's been THE BEST THING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  But... when the Covid19 thing happened... she went into a dark, dark, deep, deep place.  And she pushed me so far away that... now... we're separated.  Probably ""over"".  100%.  She was also my BEST friend.  And I mean it... my BEST friend.  :( :( :(  And now... she doesn't want to talk to me... doesn't care about me.  Doesn't want to see me.  And now... I feel so abjectly empty.  Worthless (in some ways--although not regarding my work + influence on people's lives in the past).  I can't sleep.  I couldn't eat for a month.  I had to move 500+ miles away.  My life is in a shambles... and not even therapy is helping.  Maybe a little... but... I can't explain it:  I LOST MY SOULMATE TO THESE TERRIBLE DISEASES.  PLEASE seek help as early as you can if signs appear.  Please help FORCE others to seek help if they are avoiding it, preventing it, or worse... enabling others to just sweep the problems under the rug.  My ""life""... what I had... my DREAM... my happiness--these were all forfeit.  I now simply... ""exist"".  I pray that you NEVER have to endure what I am enduring right now.  It's only a piece of the puzzle of problems, but... omg... please--pray that you never end up like me.  I just wish I never lost this sweet, amazing, talented, beautiful soul... to these terrible, demonic diseases.  :(",1,1,No one star

2020-02-18T23:09:27Z,"Unpopular opinion, but I personally would've given Tom Hanks the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Hanks took a well-known icon of the best humanity has to offer, and he made him human. In a way, it's also a meta commentary on how we view Tom Hanks, who is also considered one of the nicest celebrities of all time. Just like how he portrays Mr. Rogers, the film reminds us that Hanks, too, is only human, and one day he will pass like Fred did. But what's most important is we honor both men's legacies by spreading their message of kindness and acceptance across the world.  (Has absolutely nothing to do with Brad's performance. It's just my personal preference.)",0,0,Juno Keira Page

At that time I was battling drug addiction and depression and thanks to Fred I beat one of them. I watch reruns of the show all the time and it does help me with my depression even though I still have good days and bad days.  I try to follow his example and be a good person and even though it’s difficult as people are dickheads. I can say I wake up most mornings with a smile and most nights I go to bed with a smile thanks to Fred. He was the sweetest, kindest most gentle of people and his words really got me through the worst period of my life. I think he saved my life actually. God bless that man.

No one had said a single bad thing about him he made it impossible to hate him. And in all honesty I wanted to try and emulate him but the life I live I'm quick to anger and bottle it up before exploding, I argue about and against everything people tell me to do, and no matter what I try I cant find that kindness in me that Mr. Rodgers tries to share with everyone.  But I think we should all try to be like Mr. Rodgers not just the millenials or the boomers but all of us. The world needs someone like Mr. Rodgers who gives kindness for the sake of kindness.  This post may vanish but I hope those who see it try to be more like this man who gives kindness to even the worse of us even when we dont deserve it.",0,0,benolr64

Cause here is the fun fact the kid does not owe the parent who left anything. Half the people who this happens to feel nothing towards the parent. Only indifference.

It is a work of fiction and Lloyd Vogel is a fictional character. Which means that the ""Mr. Rogers"" in the film is also a fictional character. He may have said and done somewhat similar things with somebody at some time, but it wasn't with Lloyd Vogel, because he doesn't exist.

What a miscast and if not, Hanks totally blows it with the nauseating accent. Mr. Rogers has a largely Northern accent not a Southern accent. And if it was a unique voice it definitely didn't have a Lousiana drawn out drawl. Nauseating performance. Sorry- used to be a Hanks fan. But this is horrible work. He speaks so sloooowwwww! Also doesn't look like Mr. Rogers at all. Needs to lose 50 pounds. Steve Carrell would have been better. OR AN UNKNOWN! Hope some day they make another Mr. Rogers movie with a better actor.",1,0,Ben S

You can't explain it to kids now, they won't ever know what it was like to have that time. You didn't get reruns over and over, none of us had VCR's. You saw it that one time during the day and that was it, and that, and the shows themselves, made it special, and it's not likely to ever come again.

I guess Hollywood needed some clean restart to mix into its dirty pot of water.

2019-10-29T04:49:47Z,"As a child of the 70s I grew up watching Mister Rogers.  We only had two channels, and along with Sesame Street, this was the highlight of my day.  My father, used to think it was funny to CA him ""Fairy Rogers"" until I ended up in tears.   Not long after, my father would be moving onto his new life and I was one of the many lost and rejected kids of divorce in the 80s.   Seeing this movie makes me realize that my father needed to attack Mister Rogers because he himself was a weak man.  He never had the empathy or caring in him that a Fred Rogers had for others, and that was a threat to him. Now, 40 years later and i remember that, even if I didn't know it at the time, it was Mister Rogers and his telling me my feelings mattered that helped me through all of that, and made me into the father I try to be for my daughter, whose emotions always matter to me.

My Grandma lived not far from the studios. And she took us there when we was down for the summer. My sister was 3 when it happened. She came in the room where me Grandma and 2 other siblings where. She screamed for mom. And was walking funny. Grandma ignored it and we left. Grandma tried changing sisters diaper she refused to let Grandma changed her. Mom arrived later that night. Mom asked what happend. Grandma lied states in she fell. We got in the car mom looks at me and the other 2. Which I am the oldest. I said we went to see Fred Rogers the Mister Rogers Neighborhood Star. Mom's eyes got big dad slammed on the brakes and goes DO WHAT!! He turns and floors it back to Grandma's house. Before Grandma opens the door my mom attacks her. My sister said that Fred Rogers touched and rubbed her private part. We tried suing police department was like laughing. We never went back to see Grandma again. And mom never contacted her again even when Grandma was on her death bed. But went back to sell the house cheap. And had a garage sale and mom sold all of grandma's stuff. The people that brought the house brought the furniture in the bedrooms and living room. When we get the video of the movie and posters.

Not just being, but teaching us how to be as well.   I was dumbfounded when I found out how many countries never ran his show.  My European husband never watched him.

2019-08-20T02:30:40Z,"I (with my family) owned a few bars, and lounges in NYC. Everyday at 5/6pm we would play a Johnny Costa jazz version of ‘Wont you be my neighbor’. It always fit in well with the ambiance; and never failed to make the entire room smile. It was a message from us to them: although they’re adults now, discussing business in a cutthroat world- they still need to be a neighbor to another, and allow another to be a neighbor to them. This went on for 20 years or so. One day in 2013 I sat at the bar while this song played, and nobody noticed it. It saddened me, because I know that in these times we needed Mr Rogers the most. In these times we all are in desperate need of a neighbor. The song no longer plays in our bars and lounges. But I encourage to let someone be a neighbor to you, and you in turn be a neighbor to someone else. You may not feel like much, but to someone who needs a friendly word, you can literally be the difference between life and death.",1,0,David Hues

2019-08-16T01:10:23Z,"Tom Hanks is perfect to play Mr. Rogers. I would see such movie based on that. This trailer seems like the movie will focus on a sub character who I am guessing is Mr. Rogers's publicist/promoter. This character (who I am not sure if they are an existing person) seems like he is meant to be us, the viewer as a character in the movie and we are supposed to experience the greatness of Mr. Rogers's through him. This character will probably go through some struggle in life and Mr. Rogers will provide him the positive influence to carry through. This will be meant to help us face our own struggles in life. People will watch the movie though and say  ""who was that guy? I wanted see Mr. Rogers"". I hope I'm wrong though. Mr. Rogers was such an awesome guy and people should be able to experience that without any intervention.   What is really sad is that Mr. Rogers is gone and all we got was a cartoon cat to replace him. 😔",0,0,Video Guy

I was a child of the ‘80s and I remember watching Mr. Rodgers when I was very small...I remember it feeling VERY CREEPY and as I got older and had more “life experience” (ya know...as a kid HA) I couldn’t even bare to even click through channels in case I would see even a part of that show because it just set off alarms in my head that something was SERIOUSLY wrong with this guy.... Later on in my childhood I began to have the literally UNCANNY ability to spot people in our communities who were quite literally pedophile of the worst sort...though a pedophile of any sort is the worst sort if you ask me..... I’ve always been one of those people who can spot “THEM” even in my own family!  Looking back on that show I watching in early childhood I finally understood what I had been feeling...what those ALARM bells in my head actually meant!    In my experience there is NO ONE on the face of this earth who can ‘act’ as kindhearted, people caring, and a ‘lover’ of all individuals and NOT be a complete and total fraud!    Though I guess something in his past could have happened to give him some kind of bran damage....Or some kind of malformation of the brain at birth that can create a demeanor he seemed to have had..... There has to be a reason Tom Hanks is pulling from his character “Forest Gump 1994”.

Maybe it’s just impossible to capture the the look and feel of Fred Rogers. Behind his eyes, smile and of each movement and sound uttered from his mouth, there’s no sense of mistrust or ill-will - just genuine care.  It’s the same as someone never being able to play your parents. Something is just missing, at no fault of the actor.

2019-08-02T03:01:28Z,"I would love to see this movie. The Mister Rogers documentary from last year was so great it was almost overwhelming. But I can't deal with the insane hype machine for this relentlessly mediocre actor that's been going on for 30 years now. Every Tom Hanks movie becomes a celebration of Tom Hanks, not the subject matter or the people he plays. Even little things, like phoning it in on Fred Rogers' distinctive, world-famous, accent, and the fact (which I learned from the documentary) that Rogers was obsessive about keeping his weight at 143 lbs--a response to his childhood obesity, and a personal reminder of the words ""I (1) LOVE (4) YOU (3)."" Hanks is easily 80 pounds over that. Not a sin, but there are at least 100 great actors who could have done this role better, and the public's love of Mr. Rogers would have sold it without this guy who's more a self-important star-tripping Oscar-seeker than an actor.

I have been watching various videos though so I totally understand how much of an impact this man had on generations of children. I've read much criticism of the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the role,and some criticism of the voice/accent. My opinion is that he is a perfect choice from what I have seen. I don't think he is trying to impersonate the person,I take it to be more of a portrayal of the essence of the man and that's obviously a tough challenge.He's certainly sold it to me! For the movie to be successful outside the States,I think it had to be a big name actor for it to draw people in. I will certainly go to see this movie and hope it does well.

Mr. Rogers was a man of virtue, he refused to let his face be used for anything that would be considered unwholesome. he refused Burger King when the used him in advertising without his permission, all he did was ask the CEO to apologies and remove the ad. He didn't sue them, he didn't ask for compensation, he didn't even condemn. He got ahold of the owners and told them why he didn't like what they did. He did so many things for children and he would still be today. If a life is only worth the amount of money it can make then it isn't a life at all.

2019-07-29T14:32:29Z,"Nice try by Hanks, but as the old saying goes, the eyes are the window to the soul. Hanks eyes reveal the hate, disdain and cold harshness typical of the soul of a modern Urban Progressive Lib elite. Can't hide that, no matter how much makeup is used. He is also has an abruptness in his attempt to duplicate Rogers speech mannerisms. I always thought that Rogers deserved a movie or documentary created in his honor, but they could have chosen an actor, even an unknown that would better fit the part. I really have to watch and fact-check this movie, because Hollywood always adds their own tilt to the point of a total warp of the truth. Well, at least they did not cast Rogers wearing lipstick, a skirt and bra. Nice attempt, but this movie could have been a classic masterpiece if they just stayed away from using Hanks in the lead role.",0,0,Dawn R

Be kind, of course. Be real, be respectful. But tell the truth. Nobody likes the truth. The world is a horrible place. Stop crying and be a mensch. In the eyes of the creator you are special, but there is no such thing as a free lunch...I wish Mr.Rogers revealed that to us more than ""You're so special"".

Roger's Neighborhood ended, and didn't have the opportunity to grow up watching him. But my grandmother always tells me stories about him and how wonderful he was. I am really happy that Tom Hanks is playing him as well. I loved his movies, or whatever he played in, growing up. Like Turner and Hooch! That was an amazing movie. I'm just glad this is being made and done. And around my birthday, too none the less. 🤗 So, thank you to the creators for making this.",0,0,シュガーYuki

2019-07-26T02:18:08Z,"One day in the early afternoon I came home from a business trip. Coming thru the front door my wife greeted me with her index finger on her lips, a signal of ""shush"". She quietly took my hand and walked me over to the doorway of the family room. There I saw ten ""munchkins"", ages 2 to 7 years, absolutely enthralled and transfixed watching the TV. Each had their own bowl of melon fruit, and were eating without taking their eyes off of the TV. My wife had an after school day care she ran out of our house. Along with our two small boys at this time she on and off watch 6-8 neighborhood kids ages 5-8 years old.  I asked her what they were watching and she said this new show called ""Mr Rodgers Neighborhood"". I sat down at the dining room table to watch the show, my wife brought me a bowl of fruit, and we watched the show with the kids. Not one word was said. We just sat and enjoyed the show. What a great afternoon! Now my boys are grown men with families of their own and have moved out of state for better job opportunities and affordable houses, the neighborhood kids are grown and also moved away, and my wife pass 13 years ago.  Yet I've made new friends with the new neighbors and their kids. They're a more modern family, don't watch much TV, everything is the internet and their cell phones. I don't blame them though with all the crap on TV these days.   It's just too bad they don't have a Mr Rodgers TV show to watch together after school!  😉",4,0,baumcollc same

2019-07-25T22:21:43Z,"Looks like another addition to a great season of biopics. I would very much like Hollywood to do one  on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado.   Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.   Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""   You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter).

2019-07-25T01:39:27Z,I don’t think tom hanks is the right man for this. Maybe Edward norton would have been better. As kind and caring as Mr Rogers he had a sense of caution or reservedness to him. Careful to listen properly be polite and say the right thing.  Tom Hanks is too extroverted and schmaltzy,2,0,Grace Chan

He doesn't have the body movement down. So many actors to choose from, and they lock onto Hanks. It's as bad as if they had chosen Mel Gibson or Arnold Schwarzenneger or Bernie Sanders to play the epic, timeless Mister Rogers.

I don't know if I can watch the movie comfortably besides on my basement TV, on the downstairs couch, with three blankets, a six pack of Iron City, and soaking up sad/nostalgic tears with my terrible towel. It will be tough..  But really, Fred Rogers is even more special to me as a 35 year old.  He told the viewing children (but I always felt like he was speaking to me) that I was special.  I believed him then, and today I realize that HE made my adult life better. Because when I was young, there was a wonderful, approachable adult on tv (cartoon= not real) whom consistently explaining hard topics, with grace and understanding and with compassion to how the adult world scares children. To me, Fred was a counselor, a comfort, an adult that was encouraging, an adult that was understanding, and an adult that was there for me unconditionally.

Talking about the famous quote in there “ momma says life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you’re going to get” and then the actual quote that’s in the movie, but we (most) remember it being said just like I quoted? The list goes on, and on, but about a bunch of other famous quotes that “have changed” but most remember it a certain way..

There's never been anyone exactly like you before, and there will never be again. Only you. And people can like you exactly as you are.”  Thank you Mr. Rogers for teaching me that self worth was more important than anything and showing care for everyone, especially a child, is the best thing we could do for society.

When we hid from the evil's of the world, we had him. And we were happy. We were happy because he was there when we needed him. When we were afraid, alone, sad, hurt, angry or lost. We had him. He made us forget the world.  He was our light in this world full of darkness. And now he is dead. But his still with us. We're still here, so his still with us.  He lives on because we remeber him.  And we must pass on his memory to our children & their children's children. The kids today will never know. P.s. All those who disliked this is part of the darkness that has infected this world.

Even then, when I first learned about Mr. Rogers a year ago I was fascinated with him as a human being. Such a kind and gentle soul has never graced this earth (well except for Jesus as I believe in him but I understand not everyone does). He was a true example of what it means to be Christian. He didn’t shove his opinions on people and he truly cared for the mental health and well being of children.

Just black and white distortion and noise until the American flag 🇺🇸 would show followed by the Star Spangled Banner and then all the best shows and cartoons would roll throughout the whole day. Within those special shows that taught me so much,  Mr. Rogers was in my  top 10 favorites . Sesame Street, He-Man, Hanna-Barbera toons, ThunderCats, MASK, Knight Rider, Air Wolf, Smurfs, The A Team, The Chipmunks and many many more!

2019-07-22T22:37:00Z,I grew up watching Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and I am happy to see that there is a biopic being made about Fred Rogers.  Fred Rogers was a unique individual who cared about children and their early education. I like how he calmly and warmly addressed the television audience in each episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and how he accepted everyone just the way they were. There will never be another person like Fred Rogers.  I am looking very forward to seeing this movie when it is released in November.,0,0,Callie Kuczek

2019-07-22T22:10:58Z,"He was an ordained minister and expressed Christianity in all he did. He was kind to all, especially children. He made each and every person he met feel special. He was constantly alert to the needs of others. He sought out the overlooked and disregarded, which were usually children, but not necessarily due to cruelty, although he must have seen that throughout his life in service to others. Children are usually marginalized due to their size, mental capacity and strength, and because they depend on the kindness of adults to survive. He always raised them in importance and gave them self worth. It was not only out of kindness but with true respect and love for each and every one. While Tom Hanks is an obvious Hollywood choice, there is no one there in today’s anti Christian bias whom respects the true calling of love and kindness to all mankind a true Christian tries to manifest. It was the heart of Mr Rogers and whom and what he tried and succeeded to express with his life. Each day I entrusted my very young son, his heart and mind mostly an empty slate to this man whom I really did not know. I watched carefully as he filled his slate with dignity, security and knowledge. Most of all it was filled with kindness and respect for others and then I relaxed. My son was safe with Mr Rogers. I also saw how much my son loved Mr Rogers and it was because Mr Rogers loved him, and somehow through a box with a glass window, my son knew it.",0,0,SD

If anything I remember reading about the man who did the documentary who went in with one intent, with digging the truth and coming out to ending his documentary remembering one person who helped him in his career: his mom. That's what is Mr Rogers ultimate influence. He turned a possible realist maybe cynic into a believer of love, compassion and empathy.",0,0,Throw Away

Mr. Rogers knew how to treat his audience like people and present his topics in that manor! I very much enjoyed the ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"" Documentary as well! (I will never know or understand why it didn't get an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards!) Tom Hanks, the nicest guy in Hollywood, and one of my absolute favourite actors of all time, was born to play Mr. Rogers!

He led me through his garage, to get back, and there I made an amazing discovery... He had taken in every stray cat in our neighborhood, and half of them had kittens. There must have been 25 kittens in there! Within seconds, I sat down and been swarmed by their little meowing poof balls. Every color, kind, and age, down to little itty bitty kitties, just all over me wanting love.  It was one of the best moments of my childhood. But the best part, was getting to knock on his door every day, and go back to garage with my little brother to pet the kitties. He would bring over baskets of berries and homemade jams.

A discussion titled “Forced Live Organ Extraction in China” took place at the British House of Parliament on March 26, 2019, offering media a timely news hook to delve into the issue. Hosted by MP Jim Shannon, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on freedom of religion and belief, 12 parliament members from a number of different political parties joined the discussion, voicing their outrage and concern over the state-sanctioned crimes of forced organ harvesting in China. BBC Radio 4 covered this event with a segment that was aired the following day during its “Yesterday in Parliament” program.",0,1,mei li

2019-07-22T17:29:38Z,"I truly believe that Mr. Rogers could have gone down a different road that would have been much better for his career/bank account.  Instead, he dedicated his life to help all children the best he could.  And it was for the children  that he did this and not for himself.  He saw himself as a servant, not a celebrity.  This makes him a true hero.  When I herd that they were going to make a movie, I was so worried that it was going to parody him.  This trailer does not seem to support that worry. Looks like Tom knocks it out of the park.  Rest in peace Fred and thank you.",85,4,Bryce Jensen
