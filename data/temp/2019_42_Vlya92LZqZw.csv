2020-05-31T17:35:04Z,This movie seems to be exactly what’s wrong with horror movies today. There’s no fear of the bang only the anticipation of it. Where is the suspense now? We’ve seen all the monsters we know exactly what’s going to happen? The only remotely frightening bits are the occasional jump from a cheap jump scare.,0,0,Mark Neill

The young cast is game but the acting ranges from not-bad to over-acting to emotionless.  None of the adult characters have much to do or add anything to the story. Not sure which was more ridiculous: the perfectly performing wax cylinder player or when Mrs. Pillsbury Doughboy shows up. 😒,0,0,Catharsis

2019-09-02T03:21:09Z,"I cant tell if this movie was lackluster or catered to a specific age group. The books initially came out nearly 30 years ago, I'm aware there was a rerelease but even with that, it just seems off. It plays it very safe, it struggles to find an identity by juggling stories that come and go too fast for you to really invest anything into them. Theres a strange series of subplots, or pieces of plots, political, social, racial... they're relative to the setting but dont seem to play any significance. They're just floating around...allowing for any scene to grab one and insert it into the moment but seemingly for no reason. The cast played their roles well but their characters were hollow and random. It had vibes similar to IT(the reboot), but it doesnt give us any intamate scenes with the characters like IT does. I remember reading the books, so I was super eager to see them come to life, but they didnt seem ""scary."" They looked great, but behaved like amateurs and relied on some jump scares to really bring them home. I'm down with some jump scares, but I'm torn because I think it's a case of "" getting old."" It seems great for younger audiences but I also feel it could have done a lot more with more time. IT has plenty of young fans, but the films are also like ""epics."" Theres just not enough here for a horror fan to sink their teeth into. But it's still worth a watch, even if just for nostalgia...",1,2,reifsneider

2019-08-28T23:54:38Z,"So just saw this movie. Surprisingly much better than I thought. It actually delivered on some serious scares. Used tension to really build up to effective jump scares (as opposed to just throwing a jump scare out of nowhere). The cinematography is beautiful too. Incredible colors and angles. My big complaint is the monsters are these comically stupid cgi things. They look super creepy far away, but up close and I couldn't help but laugh. There's also some pretty awful, melodramatic acting at the end. All in all though, definitely a step above most mainstream horror. Definitely recommend. 👍🏼",0,0,DR Hall

2019-08-19T00:02:03Z,"Honestly the vibe I'm getting from this trailer is that Guillermo made this movie purely for his own gratification. Like he did this for fun. It's not meant to be taken seriously in the same way as how campfire ghost stories are meant to be scary but also a bit silly.  And I think that's what makes it good, because you go into the movie theater with the attitude that you're just there to have a bit of childish fun. Too many horror movies nowadays take themselves way too seriously and it just comes across as try-hard and pretentious. And in the end, even if you did get a couple of decent scares, you didn't really actually fully enjoy yourself.  This seems fresh and different. I'm going to watch it.",1,0,VexedOutVegan

2019-08-12T00:19:45Z,"As a 90s kid/horror genre fan who loves and still owns my original set of Scary Stories to tell in the Dark books from my childhood, here's my honest opinion: *This movie sucked monster balls!* Why'd they have to do it like this? It could've been so great! They basically took the plot from the 2015 goosebumps movie (finding a book containing the stories, which when opened then become reality) but then failed to incorporate *anything* related to any of the Scary Stories plots. No, what they did was hold a few glimpses of Scary Stories characters over the head of us nostalgic fans of the original books, luring us in with the promise of a long awaited homage to a beloved childhood horror series. Once you excitely pay your ticket and walk into the theater, expecting to love/ or at least like it, you'll soon realized that what you were actually given was a spit to the face. What should've been a decent movie turned out to be another pile of crappy preteen horror flick. This movie was built on lies and cliches! The plot was made up and cliche, the characters were cliche, the (jump)scares were cliche, it was nothing BUT cliches! Oh you people who grew up with the source material thought it was for _you?_ Lol no, it was for the kids and _your money._ I had faith in you Guillermo del Toro! I expected better! I gave you my trust, and this is how you _repay me_ 😢💔? And to anyone wondering what stories are *(poorly, some just simply mentioned)* used in this film, it's:  The Big Toe What Do You Come For? Me Tie Dough-ty Walker! The Hearse Song The Haunted House The Wendigo Harold The Dream The Red Spot There, hopefully I'll be saving you the money that I had wasted, and if you do decide to still go see it, come back here so we can be disappointed together😤. In the meantime, I'll just be revisiting my Scary Stories books, staring at Stephen Gammells haunting imagery until it chases away the bad memory that was this film.",0,0,Just Some Guy On Youtube

They look really good and scary. I wish netflix made a series with this. Every story here has so much to tell and show.

I would have liked the film  in black and white for starters and I am not too convinced about the  plot. Scary Stories was protested and banned for its violent stories and grotesque illustrations if this film isn't twisted and horrifying then  it won't do the book justice.

2019-07-16T08:25:08Z,"Ah, yes, The BEST part of the books where the Black and White water color inked illustrations gave an uncertain ethereal element to each picture. They where like as if they weren't just printed in the book, but painted on the vary pure white canvas of a child's imagination. Just like the ink-blot of the Rorschach test, to an adult, it's just a picture. To a child, you could ""feel"" the image existed deep in your mind, like a suppressed memory, ""it"" was there. ""IT"" was staring, not only at you, but INTO your very being, because ""it"" is a part of you. ""It"" is your fear drawn out in black ink, and you swear, no you KNEW that ""IT"" JUST MOVED!!!!!

Only God will listen to your suffering and your great pain, and save you from what you are suffering from, and the hearts of people will no longer feel and feel. Something in those days, I present you in the site of real stories, a very difficult human story to rape the innocence of a small child, the story is taken from a real story, entitled rape of a girl with a pen.   Rape of a child   It was raining heavily that night, the wind was strong, it moved and hit everything in front of it angrily, and the sound of the wind was high, like the roar of an angry lion mingling with the loud thunder, it was a very strange and frightening air, and everyone was hiding in their homes for fear of the cold, They abandoned the streets by passers-by, although it was only nine o'clock.   In spite of all this and those high voices, which covered any other voice, but heard the loud cry, carried by the wind in her apartment hiding from the cold, Vjmrt and went out of her place after putting on her coat heavy fur coat, to hide inside and did not care cold The heat and the warmth and the delicious warmth left to know the source of the loud cry. No one heard almost any scream. Even if someone else heard it, no one would venture out and leave.   To know who is screaming outside, cry out who screams who will care about his order in this very cold atmosphere, and that terrible apprehension, and the strange atmosphere that has not seen that coastal province, before and for many years, so the hearts of people became very cruel, even if they heard from Killing, they will not venture to know what is happening.   She stood in front of the door of one of the apartments in the building, put her ears on the door of the apartment with attention listening to the continuous whining, and shrieking screams from her neighbor's apartment, which lies in the same role and apartment adjacent to her apartment directly, so she carried the wind scream, the woman felt the fear vaguely do not know why?   The sound of the rain was loud, as if the sky was angry and angry at what the humans were doing, so I threw the little snowflakes to hit everything above the ground with a loud, high-pitched voice that caused tension in the soul and panic. , And the dreadful lightning shatters the darkness of the sky to light it, with high thunderbolt strikes.   As if it were the day of the end of the earth, it was truly a frightening and terrifying atmosphere. A human being feels his weakness in front of the Creator's ability, but despite all this she heard the deafening screams of the girl clearly, from behind the door that placed her ears on him.   The woman asked with tension and whispered to herself with concern, shaking her head Lake:   Is she the small son of her neighbor who screams inside?   Baraa is a young girl who did not complete her tenth year, and the daughter of her neighbor and close friend who serves as her sister, and the spirit of her soul asked the woman with great tension,   I wondered with concern, Is the young girl is screaming inside and what happened to her, you were not sure of something, her mind was confused and uncluttered stood stood listening and listening anxious, Do you hear the voice of a man with her inside the apartment, O disaster Is what a real hearing.

The art was actually done by a regular children's illustrator and it was the only time he drew anything dark like that.  Just his magnum opus....and the publishers have since found out that their book is ultra-frightening and have replaced the art with some watered-down lukewarm trash.

2019-06-04T21:16:18Z,"I like that the monsters look just like they did in the original. But also, They weren't just Monster books. One of favourite stories Was called I think The Room Number? A girl and her mother check in at a Paris hotel, The mother grows ill (it doesn't seem too serious) and sends the girl to fetch some medicine from a doctor in the next town over,  on her way to the doctors she realizes that the cab she's in has been driving in circles. and they're still about 2 hours away. They finally get there and the Doctor invites her in, he goes on for some time about mundane things. She asks him about the medicine and avoids the question, yet again, she finds herself wasting time and staying there several hours longer than she needs to be, the Doctor finally gives her the medicine,  its now nighttime, so he offers to let her stay until morning, when getting a cab will be easier. She declines and calls a cab, only for one to show up hours later. She finally gets on her way and realizes this cab is also driving in circles, growing frustrated and desperate to get this medicine to her mother,  she jumps out and makes her way to Paris by morning, when she arrives at the hotel she finds (I Think) the name of the hotel has changed, when she goes in, she sees the same employee. Who claims to have never seen her before. None of the staff claim to have seen her before and there's no record of her or her mother checking in. She goes to the room only to find the decor completely changed and her mother nowhere to be seen. The story ends there but the excerpt at the back of the book claims that what we don't know is that while she was out her mother died of the plague and to keep the city from panicking, they simply sent people to stall her and keep her away for as long as possible. When she gets back,  they simply erase her mother from history, leaving her confused and alone.   Could be recounting the story incorrectly, as I've not read it for about ten years.",0,0,Alex Haven Blackburn

I remember IT was the one that scared me the most ( I'll never forget the Kitchener Ironworks part ). I remember being in line at B. Dalton Bookseller one day waiting to buy Nightmares & Dreamscapes and looking at the Halloween display up at the register which had a lot of spooky books. I Immediately noticed Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark because of the awesome artwork on the cover. I bought it on a spur of the moment along with my other book and I was so glad I did.

When Tales From the Crypt did their movie, it was put into different stories from the comic books. That’s how I personally feel is should of been done. Take the best stories and make a two hour movie out of it, make a sequel, and there you go.

2019-06-03T18:32:52Z,None of this looks scary to me. It feels like Goosebumps meets Tales From the Crypt. I wish Del Torro focused more on building suspense instead of full out monster makeup and cgi craziness. It’s too “on the nose” and whimsical to have any kind of real impact. I think the real draw of the books is that you’re a child reading these stories and imagining them in your head along with those sick charcoal illustrations. I’m skipping this movie and I imagine most adults will too.,2,2,naw man
